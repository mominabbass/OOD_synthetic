"I wonder if Derrick Watson realizes what a fool his name has become nationally?  To make a 44 page judgement in 2 hours is bad enough, but his reasoning of basing the injunction on what candidate Trump has said in the past, is absurd, and the country is in disbelief that a judge could overstep his authority to this level.  The corruption in the Democrat party really knows no boundaries, and  is constantly pushing the envelope further and further to the left.  Sad and such an embarrassment to Hawaii.  Of course, Chin isn't from Hawaii, so if things get bad here, hey just go back to Seattle and all will be fine."

"Trudeau speaks in progressive riddles and broad idealist puffery void of anything that could be considered a coherent message. His lobbying description is equivalent to suggesting sex with a condom doesn't count, he's embarrassing himself - Trudeau is regressing further into hypocrisy and ignorance by pretending that subscribing to a higher ""progressive"" moral authority gives him carte blanche to do whatever he wants. Just look at the climate deal, how much will it cost the average taxpayer? Eye rolls and contempt from Trudeau and Butts - don't ask questions, it's 2016, sunny ways and all that..."

"""I have no idea what to say in rational response to such an extreme (and I might add, insulting to at least half the nation) take on the election success of the president elect.""

Really, utilitas?   Trump didn't get the support of over half the nation.  He finished second in the popular vote, and over 100 million voters didn't vote out of either indifference or Republican voter suppression.  Considering that the president-elect is a lying, misogynist, racist ignoramus who is including neo-Nazis in his inner circle, perhaps those voters who voted for him deserve to be insulted."

The best thing that could happen is to stop the idiocy of the emx boondoggles. Keep writing to Trump like I do bringing the waste and mismanagement of ltd to the president's attention.

Bill Clinton was the only president of the US whose penis was described in court proceedings while he was in office,  possibly the only leader of any country. Really hard to fathom why Knox would have wanted to give this vicious, sexual predator and his rebarbative slut-shaming wife a third term in the White House. Thank God she and her accomplices didn’t succeed."

Typical hypocrisy from the social justice warriors, push junk science and mediocrity like womens studies, or LGBT studies or forced native lobby indoctrination.  There's a reason they hate math and science and focus on stupidity like this, they take the money from the kids that work hard and find employment, and hand them to idiots who choose to demand things from everyone else under the guise of 'equity', lets call it what it is, Communism and Totalitarianism.  Hey TDSB, look at Zimbabwe and Venezuela, communists have killed millions and contrary to SJW beliefs, Communists have a very corrupt .001%, and those regimes weren't pretty at all."

Even while Obama investigated and illegally surveilled some media members the bulk of these creeps still supported his criminal activities and utilization of government agencies to batter his political opponents.

He and his crew were the  worst criminals ever to occupy the W.H.  History will not be kind to Obama when the research and exposures are written.  He took advice from a known slumlord and crooked operator.

"More manufactured fake news. First, Trump is not the founding father of the white supremacists despite all the media's attempt to make it look like he is, and that's ignorance. Second, his two day delay to condemn that group has to do with waiting for the facts to come out, and not because he supports them. The leftist media jumped the gun on several occasions, and many people paid the price for it with their jobs gone, but the fools never learn. Trump is an outsider, the establishment hates him -most Democrats and some Republicans because they liked their comfy business as usual positions to ruin our country."

"A quote from your article Joan - ""For instance, no major news media devoted time during this electoral cycle to teaching the American public the advantages or disadvantages of any single political promise.""  I'm surprised at your naivete Joan in stating that no major news media devoted time to teaching.... the major news media is corporate owned and specialists in fake news.  Your election times are a circus for the world to behold and many many people in your country woke up to the fact that your 'major news media' did not do its job precisely because it is fake news.  It doesnt matter what corrupt puppet your voters want, it is a farce giving you all the illusion you have control.  (Don't worry - very similar in our country).

Are you comparing the peaceful march in Seattle to people hanging blacks from streetlights?  I'm not sure how you can draw any comparison between the two.

What an absolutely stupid comment. The supply of lawyers is also dictated by off shore schools. Seeing that only1 in 11 students get into a Canadian Law school when they apply what happens to the ten? Well maybe 2 or 3 give up the rest go off shore. Bond University in Australia has a complete Canadian Law school and the other kids go to the United States or Britain - then they come back and the Canadian Federation of Law Societies lets them take catch up courses and bingo they write the Bar and are lawyers. Seeing that 1/3 of the students that wrote the Bar in Ontario last year received their education off shore that means the law societies do control the amount of lawyers. Nice try though.

And have you noticed that the monthly Federal deficits have gradually been creeping up.  now they're at 3.3 billion for a single month. If you have the slightest idea how a federal government constructs its finances you would grasp that it is the trend that kills.  Your pal Trudeau campaigned on the basis of 10 billion dollar deficits for a few years... The finance department itself has said we will see deficit till 2050. Canadian banks are forecasting deficits 35 to 40 billion dollars and we're now well on the way to achieving them.

Stop watching Clinton News or reading Globalism and Marxism. (Its an analogy it'll tell us how bright you are)"
Absolutely ridiculous! Didn't Anchorage taxpayers buy a military tank?
Well that's a comment straight out of a Trump Rally.  Even I saw that one on the news.  Try to think like a big boy and come up with an original comment so we don't have to keep calling you an idiot.
Lol what kind of loser likes his own comment.  Doofus
Fully support this.
It appears she is a P O S T I T U T E.....
"It's a sad and bitter irony that those posing as Israel's ""friends"" are moving it ever closer to absolute destruction.

Not surprised a man as deeply ignorant of history as Trump does not understand this.  However Netanyahu must, at some level, realize the world is against Israel's constant expansion and that having one friend in the world (USA) is simply not security enough."
I'm not shooting anyone so why make such a ridiculous declaration. That's an emotional negative in itself. Everytime there is a shooting and especially a mass shooting you are asking those shot to give up their lives and their freedoms to please you. So give it some thought in how we can better solve the problems where no one loses their freedoms.
"Like most democrats he is desperate to spin the story in his favor.  Hard to argue with facts.  This guy should never have been let into the USA ... yet liberal immigration policies see Canada ands the USA and all of Europe being flooded with religious zealots who will never integrate into our society.  

Immigration can only maintain the confidence of the populace if you properly extreme vet and only allow in people who make the country better.   The absolute test must be ""does this persons presence make Canada (or other jurisdiction) a better place than it is without them""?

Unfortunately the answer is often a no ... and we let them in anyways ... and then act surprised when they slaughter our citizenry or abuse our social safety nets or spread their religious hatred to others.  

Foolish but predictable ....  liberals and democrats open your eyes please."
"Of course she will Win!!! The Liberals hold that seat with no problem. Think about this, Wynn and the Ontario Liberals are the most Corrupt party ever in Canada. They still may in the next election. Ontario does NOT care if the Liberals are corrupt. The Ontario voters were Rated the dumbest people in all the whole  world."
"The press is the enemy. They have an agenda. Disgusting. They are fake news. Nothing they say is to be trusted. They have put our country in danger. Treasonous! I will never trust those bunch of pompous jerks, again."
"It incredible that the liberal press cannot see how they are burying themselves.
From the very first day, the have maligned Trump at every opportunity.
The problem is everything their black Jesus did was wrong for America and everything Trump has done is correcting the crap Obama did.
The press keeps attacking Trump, while the band plays on"
Disgusting.
"That's such a ridiculous comment ...... If you have cancelled your subscription, how come you are still reading this newspaper? Grow up!"
"This is far from being a ""gratuitous smear"". Trump's angry, racist remarks about Mexicans and Muslims have emboldened the alt-right and other white supremacist groups who now feel it's acceptable to attack anyone who doesn't meet their white, Christian American standards."
I have to wonder why we have such an increase in crime this past year.  Is it because we don't have enough police and people actually think they'll get away with it?  Is it because of drug addictions? Gang activity?  Lack of jobs?  No decent health care?  Crummy wages?  Idiots for parents?  Escaping the law from the Lower 48?  Homelessness?
"You know what he meant, just had to be an ass over spelling."
"... damn straight cash is king in the USA... bigot bakers can suck daddy's big ol' ... ;)

May the USA be RID of 'christian' Republican racist sexist bigots ASAP these folks are holding the USA back!!!  I'll dance on their graves when they DIE!!"
"Wait you think this prove Clinton was doing illegal shit?  Thank god I have brain, I would hate to be you."
The very best part of this was Corbyn stuffing it right in the faces of the blairite scum in his party and the mainstream media.
"trump is scary stupid, scary ignorant, scary uneducated and scary crude.  he must really be a very insecure man... like hitler.  churchhill had his eye on hitler and the natzi party for a long time. he knew that the natzi's plan to take down england would be a goal of germany.  he really worked FDR to join and send relief.  england was broke.  the american people weren't so aware of hitler, but FDR was....an anti german move would be hard to sell as there were so many GERMAN IMMIGRANTS (how dare them emigrate here!) in the states.  how many of you all have german blood in your ethnicity?  i have some. i'm the descendant of a dirty german  immigrant! and a scottish one, and an irish one, and an english one and a danish one and some indian blood from a canadian tribe.  wonder what the donald's lineage is?"
"LOL, Captain Crayons,, hilarious! Will this moron from the land of unicorns and rainbows ever stop earning uncomplimentary nicknames"
"The State Stole half your dividends, and you all bent over and took it ! Our Politicians are crooks, but thanks for the article on applying for this year's handout!"
Looks like lefties can kiss their progressive utopia goodbye.
"You think the economic problems are because oil producers over extending themselves thanks to near 0% interest rates,, ???? are you really that stupid!! yes obviously, blaming the oil crash and economy issues on interest rates here? god what an idiot,  the world oil prices crashed, are very slowly coming back but notley and justin are doing the damnest to keep it down with all the new taxes etc too.."
"They can't win for losing! 
Adam Schiff get your head out of the sand. Feeling very sorry for the lefts stupidity."
"whatever it takes to annoy liberals! They don't care how stupid they look,  by gum, to annoy those libtardz!"
"I have known 2 individuals who contracted polio as children before the polio vaccine. Both had affected limbs and not pretty.  One was my father and they both managed all right but I can assure you, were he alive today he would take these idiots to task."
Nice teeth!
"Not her personally, but the sovereignty fringe movement she supports, silly."
Who ordered the orange clown?????
"I agree totally, Chris. But I see that the usual right-wing trolls on this forum don't agree at all. 
I attribute that to ignorance. I guess they've never heard about Mussolini and Hitler, the last far-right leaders elected in Europe."
"FOX NEWS!  LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL

Only morons watch faux news.  You silly hyblerbhil"
"PS, I feel kinda bad for you.  All the Hate is coming from you and your fellow hate monger democraptics.  (sp intentional)  You people have called  Trump everything in the book.  You are tone deaf to your own party spewing hate. Did you notice the big COLLUSION theory you all have spouting was just more BS.   Months and months of ""He's colluding with Russia"", but no, just more Democraptic nonsense.  I can only wonder why Trump doesn't hit back harder."
"Lots of republicans on suicide watch today. The republican party as they knew it is no more.

Just a group of racist, misogynist, bigoted dim bulbs is all that's left."
typical REPUBLICAN crooks is what i call em
"trump playing ""chicken"" with China with our country at stake is very dangerous and just plain stupid."
"Just as I predicted, your head exploded - ten angry post directing mad gibberish at me like a two-year-old throwing a tantrum. Very entertaining! I feel your pain! GFY, GBA."
"I find it interesting that most of your own comments are in and of themselves  ""ill minded comments"" and constitute attacks on people.  The arrogance in this statement, for example: ""I find it interesting that you don't acknowledge the faults in your thought process, especially once you've been called out on them"" followed immediately by the hypocritical statement: "" I don't attack anyone""  then, ""Think about it or at least try to think about it."" You clearly attack others.  You're also a grade A+ asshole."
Yes he has been in office for almost 100 days and what the hell has he done except use tax payer dollars to go on trips to Florida to play golf.  He makes Obama look like a tightwad.   And what exactly do you want to Donald to get done?   Lob more bombs into countries halfway around the world?  Build a stupiod wall?  Transform America into Orwell's Oceania?  This phony is so out of his league it is pathetic.
"Just shoot me now. This is so NOT what Canada needs: it's own version of a failed businessman turned reality TV ""star"" who is an obnoxious, pompous, self-absorbed, bombastic, egotistical, professed know it all. Like Trump, he is a charlatan and a fake. If we end up electing a mini-Trump like O'Leary, I don't know where I will move to.... Scandinavia?"
"It's interesting that the RG doesn't see the connection between this and the alt left mob protests in Eugene. These McCarthyist fueled ""movement"" is, at its heart, a neo Nazi movement and anti-semitism is a part of that. You cannot both accept these terrorists and condemn anti-semitism at the same time. These are NOT liberals. They are intolerant radical thugs."
"Got any proof to back up your nonsense allegations, such as say when they were charged for insider trading. Your Harper infatuation is pathetic."
"pack up illegal scum, everyone going bye bye. take the meth and heroin with you, pigs! All forks pigs you are going too, easy to find you here in small town. Ice and BP have you in their sights."
"Trump is a weak man's idea of a strong man, a poor man's idea of a rich man, and a stupid man's idea of a smart man."
"The demo's started this fiasco and tried to dump it on the other party when it went off all the cliffs. It's dying a slow death and in order to save it some painful decisions are needed.. well, the dems sure as hell don't want to do that and haven't. They talk the good talk but certainly don't walk it. Someone has to fix this mess, or it's off the rails in another year. Costs have tripled since its inception and it's not available as more pull out of the markets. At minimum, now that the ball is rolling, the demos will have to participate in the senate or explain why to their idiots back home that sent them. Re pubs will need to to work across that divide too.  It's not about Young, focus on the real problem."
"Ummm....yeah.
Make up your own history much.
You are a liar."
"really, this old fool has never said one nice thing about a republican that I can remember"
"Yep. No big surprise is it? We can't get rid of Trump and his hypocritical religious nut wingman, Pence, quickly enough."
A significant percentage of gun deaths are due to suicide and criminal on criminal crime. You are either ignorant on the matter or simply being dishonest.
"How much longer is this mentally deranged fool going to continue playing ""president"", in what is becoming a dangerous unreality show before he is is stopped? It's time."
Were you the rube then? Actually you sound kind of like a boob!
"This has got to be one of the most ignorant and stupid articles I have read. The author of this article just offended a huge segment of the population, but then again, when you write for a free cage liner like WW, then I guess you can be an idiot."
16 days- can't somebody distract this idiot
The only thing malignant is that tumor you call a brain that makes you so stupid.
"Time for Canada to turn it's back on the corrupt Liberals.  There should be ""NO CASH FOR ACCESS"".  Kathleen is doing it and now Junior is doing it.

How do people think that if I give a politician money to go to one of his dinners that he won't bend any rules for me.  This is absolutely insane for us to allow any form of this.

For Trudeau to say that influence will not happen for cash means he believes Canadians are stupid.  Are we really that stupid?  I hope not."
"I don't back ISIS, rather it is republicans who back them.  GW by igniting the middle east with his never ending wars, showed that.  He played right into their hands.  How dumb was that?  Doing it while reducing taxes was even stupider."
Buffet is scum....how do you think he got so rich?  And why do you think he supported Hillary?
"""What you need to know?"" There will be nothing new from Trump; it will just be the same bunch of lies and constant move to increase the swamp and make himself and his cronies wealthier at the expense of the American people. I can't believe that Americans have been this stupid."
There are no Democrats in North Dakota.  It's one of Donald's safe places.
Perhaps some people on this page should enter politics...  seems fitting since the ignorance and blatant stupidity of comments would certainly guarantee a seat in provincial politics....
They're definitely in a pattern of doubling down on the stupidity.
Smacks of fascism. How can a government deploy its police to bully citizens on behalf of corporate interests? You don't like our offer so we're going to send goons to beat you into submission? This is what the mafia does.
Finally something we can ALL agree on--Mr. Lines meets everyones' definition  of a scumbag.
Scumbag racist
"This man sounds insane, totally lost it, classic case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. What could he possibly be thinking of to make such outrageous and ridiculous claims about the president? Does he have no clue as to how he looks and sounds when he is saying such patently false things? Does he think the American people are so stupid as to believe anything he is saying? Buy a vowel, a majority of Americans were not impressed and didn't support his efforts against President Nixon. Hounding a legitimately elected president out of office is nothing to be proud of, Carl Bernstein has not improved with age. He is still the same arrogant a-hole he has always been in the past."
"Chrisin, that was a truly a idiotic rambling of nothing. You are correct this is not a left leaning country, Hillary is. What are you upset about??? I bet you are just ranting against the white man..."
Not to mention the fact that Comrey will be testifying and the investigation into Trump/ Russia is getting serious.
Must be confusing it with the other up and comer Covfefe. Moron.
"Politicians today are liars, cheats and
useless tools. We need to step back to a
time when the elite shut up and the men
are allowed to straighten the scum out.
But liberals don't want that, as they'd
have nothing for distraction anymore.
2019 trudeau has to go."
"Only idiots believed collusion anyway. Hey, how about those emails that showed the media colluded with Hillary to defeat Bernie? That is an actual scandal....WHERE ARE YOU ON THAT Chris?"
"Take a look at the waistline of Alberta's ""fat cow"" health minister. By the way I am one of her ""sewer rats"". 
My previous comment of a simmilat nature was removed which means it is okay to call people ""sewer rats"" if you are a socialist politician but not to call politicians ""fat cows"" if you are a conservative - the hypocrisy stinks G&M."
No $shit Sherlock I am biased! Trump is a total disaster!
"Well, the OP singled out one religion, and claimed that students wanted a mosque in school, which is complete nonsense.  

If the OP has an issue with the law, then it should only be changed when it is applied uniformly to all religions.  When Catholic schools are shut down and no one is allowed to pray or celebrate religious holidays in public schools, then the prayer room should also be eliminated.  Until then, it's quite hypocritical to say that Muslims shouldn't be allowed to pray for an hour a week when we have entire taxpayer funded schools dedicated to sects of Christianity."
"Used to always watch them at Sparkey's after work before they hit it big, those were good times.  So glad you beat the hell out of your addiction Kelly Boy!"
Stop talking about this trash. Next you will b devoting columns to the Kardashians. It is garbage. Ignore it & keep it out of our news(?)paper.
"White people suck..
Black people suck..
Yellow people suck..
Brown people suck..
Humans in general suck...
Rant over thank you..."
Trump will have the rest of the world against him in everything if he persists in his stupidity.
"As happy as you may have been to leave I assure you that many of us were positively delighted. From the insane and embarrassing effort to portray Moochelle as the most beautiful and glamorous woman in the history of the world to the hero-worship of her dim-witted husband, we were trapped in an 8 year nightmare. I hope I never have to see your angry, bitter face again. Get over yourself."
you 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
What a buffoon Trump is! Should he not have screened his Justice Secretary particularly well? I'm not a fan of Sessions and his racist past but he had no choice but to recuse himself when his contacts with the Russians were revealed.
"Honolulu Hawaii, just another Democratic cesspool of cronyism and corruption !!!"
I thought that Bannon was scary but it turns out he is a moron.  The bishops should send him a fruit basket for making them look good.  It is the first time in ages that they have gotten good publicity from the press and lots of kudos from the public.
"""Evil"" is a most appropriate word for  Trump.
He brags that doesn't read books, and shuns reports. He  does not need to because, he ""just knows.""
That is called omniscience. It is associated with Gods.
In this case, an evil orange God."
"Good riddance scum...
Great Job Cheif Jewkes and staff."
"While it's true that all media make mistakes, it's foolish to brand all of them as the enemy.  Yes, one should also keep the bullshit monitor turned on, should always be skeptical, but effectively putting Breitbart and its ilk in the same class as NYT, NBC, WaPo, CBC, etc. is just stupidly self-defeating."
"Did I not quote the unscripted PM Gomer from the 2013 Mansbridge transcipts in the context of the Boston Marathon bombings?
 
Further, on those poor misunderstood Boston Marathon terrorists: ""During questioning, Dzhokhar alleged that he and his brother were motivated by extremist Islamist beliefs.""

So yes, there is at least one Canadian fool who sees ""terrorists, of the Islamic or far right variety (extremists of any kind), as poor and misunderstood."" So Thomas, are you also part of that group of fools?"
Is HiLIARy so dumb she does not realize the reason she lost was her?
"We need to remember.... the right smart liberals told us dumb electorate this already .... this is all far to complicated for us to possibly understand, so they won't bother trying to explain it to us dummies.  Just accept their word, 'cause they are good for it. Right? 

Unbelievable."
"Your an a-hole, how about a ceiling over bombardier?  I mean how many different entities taking it to court for illegal pampering does it take for a French Trudeau to finally say no more money.  And how about that pollution from all of the manufacturing in the region?  You know, of all the cars, trucks, ski-doos/sleds, airplanes, etc. being built that all burn that nasty oil?I am so sick of hypocrites like you, Codierre and Trudeau."
Joshua Boyle brings a new meaning to the words irresponsible and stupid. Incredible  stupidity in all this story is his and only his.
"Sure Lazee. Continue to rationalize your support of an idiotic demagogue with paper-thin excuses about ""dumping a lifelong politician"". Intelligent observers saw the differences between Clinton and Trump quite clearly with Clinton being a competent establishment candidate with clearly defined policy initiatives, and Trump being a thin-skinned megalomaniac in far over his head with aggressively bad policy proposals, where he bothered to come up with any, that is. Of course, no one has accused you of being an intelligent observer, have they?"
Moose too - damned moose and squirrel!
"It provably too late now, however, if you CI clergies & religious all speak up with 'Christ-like integrity' against clergy sex abuses of children, this problem will end in no time!
Yet you unethical, pompous attitude of believe in religious superiority as a clergies/religious decide to support the rapes of children by your silence till your soul will 'burn in hell'.
You clergies/religious do not believe there is a living God who is immanent in children, do you?
You don't believe in Holy Mary who is the mother of all souls on earth, do you? 
If you do not believe in these spiritual realities on earth, just give up being a clergy/religious! 
I think we can do all better without you spiritual hypocrites!"
"It's pretty simple to condemn BOTH the alt-right racist scum  and awful anti-Western attitudes like those the Islamists have.

"oh, zinkie's FEELINGS are hurt because one of her favorite 'minorities' can'ta  live in fantasy world and BE SUPPORTED BY THE US TAXPAYERS!   Why should US taxpayers have to pay for their operations and LIFETIME medicines?  The tran is out of action for 238 days of action in the military (according to a study done last year) and CANNOT defend the country!  So why do we need such useless deviants  in the military if they can't perform mission one???  But zinky wants to FEEL GOOD.  and zinkie felt so good using her gutter language in writing about President Trump.   Here's a suggestion for zinky: go find yourself another country that's living in a fantasy world of your preference."
"Back in the 60's and 70's it was the rage of the left that it was global cooling... they shouted about the coming ice age... all due to man and oil. Late 80's they switched thier narrative in the opposite direction... ""global warming""!! Due to man and oil.
You do see point here??? 
Are you that young and dumb???"
"What a waste of time.   The Paris accords is all part of the globalist agenda to sell carbon credits and push the false global warming scheme
now called climate change since global warming has not been occurring.  The  goal is to reduce the quality of life for the West to third world while
elevating the third world countries to be on par with the new reduced quality of life for the West.  The ultimate goal is global control by the
One World Order fanatics.
Unfortunately  our political ruling elite have all signed up to promote this agenda.  Most are ""useful idiots"" wanting to jump on the train
for their own selfish interests."
From the same fools who would have us double military expenditures while denying climate change.  Typical.

My comment exactly.  And the Dumbacrats are right there with them peddling this crap.
Wait for it... here comes da tweet with the words loser and low ratings.

Russia has been openly embraced, and the move is on to ditch Ukraine and Georgia, and the removal of sanctions seems to be on the agenda. Your run for cover is disgusting to me - it is appeasement - it didn't work with that other racist liar which cost the world so much in the 1940s.

Trudeau speaks out of both sides of his face. In one breath he's telling Trump he's ready to get down to business and that he'll work with him. And the next he's tweeting how proud he is of Canadian women opposing President Trump. He's nothing but a  liar​ and a hypocrite.

"To all you DUMB AF RIGHT WING MORONS more butt hurt about ""protests"" than the DEATHS OF UNARMED AMERICANS, first of all FOK YOU, secondly idiots, the NFL CONTRACTS and MONEY is not dependent on RATINGS YOU ABYSMALLY STUPID PEOPLE. When NBC, CBS, ESPN ETC gives you BILLIONS  ( 20.4 BILLION to be exact) you simply don't NEED RATINGS! The only people you are hurting with your stupid boycott are the people who work at the NETWORKS, the NFL will be just fine. Read it and weep , MORONS. 

Until the broadcast contract ended in 2013, the terrestrial television networks CBS ($3.73B), NBC ($3.6B) and Fox ($4.27B) — as well as cable television's ESPN ($8.8B) — paid a combined total of US$20.4 billion to broadcast NFL games.

"This woman is a menace!! Another example of violent career criminals who have no intention to change and will continue to hurt anyone they  feel like hurting.  Get this lowlife scum off our streets!! WTF is wrong? People, wake up! Our justice system is a joke. Punishment for crime is a joke. Repeat offenders are a joke. Sentencing is a joke. Bail is a joke. Bottom line, people the joke is on us! We are the ones that pay for these asshats. We are the ones they hurt. We are the ones that live afraid to go certain places at certain times out of fear of these people. Nothing will change or get better until we realize our justice system, laws, punishments and how victims are treated is addressed and completely changed. When is enough enough? When are we going to take back our city and protect our people??

Sweden is now the rape capitol of Europe and second in the world in rapes per capita, all thanks to the Muslim invaders.  They don't think like we do.  They do not share our values.  They have no respect for women, the environment, animals, or human life.  McElroy is naive and a fool.  Hopefully Darwins principle removes him from the picture because what he preaches is cultural and religious suicide.  A war is coming over the fate of the earth - Islam or Christianity.  We all need to pick which side we want to be on and quit consorting with the enemy."

"Two of the top educational systems in the world are in Singapore and Finland. They have for many years destroyed the US in terms of student outcomes. 

Singapore has a highly structured top-down system with  tightly scripted control of curriculum and testing for all students from the central government. Finland has a similar approach - there is no such thing as a private school - and many credit its success to 1) placing a high national value on the teaching profession and paying teachers accordingly and 2) paid high-quality universal preschool and daycare for all kids ages 3-7.

Neither country touts ""school choice"". They have committed to, and invest appropriately, in a consistent and top notch universal education for ALL of their country's students.  

But don't let facts get in the way of your effort to tear apart the US educational system. Carry-on with your ignorance..."

Do these people think their down right stupid and worthless statements mean anything.  They are just adding to the chorus of the ANTIFA, Resistance and other sore losers that don't have a life or don't have jobs. How stupid has the Democratic Party become to fail to realize that throwing everything under the bus leaves them with no credibility?  Working class Americans, blue collar workers, unionized workers, middle class workers, Christians, minorities, legal aliens, legal immigrants and the myriad others that were the base of the Democratic Party are now shunned and vilified by the elected and appointed Democratic politicians.

How hypocritical, Gerry."

Non-violent dissent is a right in the US.

2) The US avoids violence when it can.  NK systematically uses violence against its own citizens and is currently threatening many countries around the world with annihilation because they have criticized NK.

3) The US basically observes international law.  NK regularly breaks international law, especially UN sanctions.

4) NK is based upon autarky. The US trades globally.

5) Military service is compulsory in NK and voluntary in the US.

6) NK leadership is based upon a divine cult of personality. US politicians are political pinatas.

7) NK believes that Koreans are the master race. The US severely punishes racists.

NK is an awful dictatorship run by a fascist, lunatic thug.

1. CMHC just said it was not supply and demand. ""We continue to see strong evidence of problematic conditions in Toronto’s housing market.

2. Prices have not stabilized as you say, down -17% in Toronto in last 11 weeks. Some GTA towns are down 20 to 30%! That is called a correction and crash for some.

3. The new regulations will drastically impact house sales. It already has! Once OSFI  forces a 2% stress test on uninsured mortgages (80% of total), it will turn heads, Rising interest rates will also slow this down considerably.

"So, how are you idiots coming on that 0bama dossier, with college transcripts and criminal records?"
"Boots>  You really are a ""jerk!""  All you do is spout about ""fear, fear and more fear.""  Isn't it that you're the one who is actually afraid of the muslims?

Have a nice day!"
"Waters has done NOTHING for her 'constituents'. She IS a master politician though, continually convincing the dumb and helpless that 'A vote for Maxine' will make their lives better. Those lives have never gotten better, and they wont be. She's convincing in her lies when she tells them that all of their lives are bad because of Whitie. Her race-baiting skills are amazing. 
PS. Her mansion is closer to $4,000,000, but you're right, it's not in her district. She's become too elitist (like all good liberals), to live with her voting masses..."
"you lefties were happy to live off alberta proping you up for years in equalization payments but now nothing for the west, typical of the idiot liberals.. as for diversity, well see idiot, that comes from the supply and demand in a free market not some government program ,"

"klastri, your party is not doing any better so stop acting like the pompous fool that you are."
And you're voting for the pathological liar then.....
The Republic party and Lapierre plus gun manufacturers are amoral thugs.
"""Since most Americans are crazy""

Here we see the breathtaking hypocrisy of the Left on full display with all the ugly racism that it claims to oppose.

McElroy: Go to Mexico and be a Bishop down there. You sicken me.
The Globe & Mail anti-Trump bias has infected the investing pages.  Time to cancel my subscription.  I don't need to pay for this trash.
That is a pipe dream unless you live in a warm climate. And do you intent on heating our house how. The idiot Liberals in Ontario have sent the price of electricity sky high through their mismanagement. Liberals totally not fit to govern

Well Trudeau is a secret Muslim
Rochdale - you odious troll.  The stuff that comes out of your rear has more substance than what comes out of your mouth.
"They're traitors against the US, stop worshiping losers."
"You sir, are a liar or simply misinformed.  Trudeau the Younger simply chose not to live there, the mansion hasn't been condemned."
"You want 'malignant'?  How about holding up a decapitated effigy of the President and Democrats think it's a hoot?
How about producing plays where the President is assassinated and the left goes wild?
How about a Democrat going to a baseball field to massacre Republicans and the Democrats...especially the scum Obama...show little outrage?
And then we have Democrat women dressing up in the ""C"" caps and vagina suits prancing around and calling out for his assassination.
MALIGNANT?  YOU are an IDIOT!"

"The country's 'wealth'?  You think he is stupid enough to rely on this county's 'wealth'?

 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac obligations are  excluded from that debt figure.

Guaranteed obligations, where the US 'guarantees' to cover losses like mutual funds, banks, and corporations are excluded from that debt figure.

Unfunded obligations like mandatory payments for programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  are excluded from that debt.

""Wealth""!  Snort!"

You sound simple.
Dumbest comment of the month.

You would have to be a fool to be a spy in Russia.
Ontario's public school system was once Christian. Pierre Trudeau eliminated that. You Muslims should have to give up your religion too.
"Mr. Philip, your column is both arrogant and stupid. The day may come in some future century when the world no longer uses oil for its energy needs but that day is not now. The demand for oil both in Canada and beyond creates an opportunity for jobs and prosperity for all Canadians. And Pipelines are the most environmentally safe methods of getting our oil to market. You provide no alternative method for this and ultimately that is what makes your article so stupid."

"Great preseason, Ducks! Now the real season starts. The pitchers will be better, the batters will be better, and the fielders will be better. Games will be tighter, and sometimes you may be behind. But play loose and confident just as you have been. Believe in your teammates and your talent, which has never been better at Oregon. Three excellent pitchers, a batting lineup that just keeps hitting and hitting, and great fielding. The other Pac-12 teams should be worried, but they won't back down until you make them. Keep up the good work, and Go Ducks!"
Liberalism is really a mental disorder.

"You obviously have zero understanding of what an English Canadian is, believes and would do. The US is a complete mess, bankrupt, full of violence, loaded with weapons of all kinds and the target of most of the hate in the world.

Why would anyone, anytime, suggest such a ridiculous idea?"
Your an idiot
