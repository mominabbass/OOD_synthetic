"Trump pulled Gillespie down into the cesspool, but the voters of Virginia have obviously had more than their fill of Trump.

"It's the same everywhere, not just the US. Yet Trump and his ilk expect the world to bow to them and give the rest of us the short end of the stick. His tariff talks will create trade wars and make everything very expensive in the US. Does he really think no one will stand up to these threats? He's all about him and how no one else in the entire world is of the same caliber or worth (and I don't mean $$$-wise). Me, me,me, I,I,I.

It's all there. But you're blinded by partisanship."

They don't think about wether it's the right person, the right to a defense etc.. They are like a bunch of junk yard dogs. It's almost amusing how Trump manipulated them to gain power isn't it? These people have no thought process in regard to their condemnation. I guess the Middle East won after all because these idiots gave them their way. Divide and conquer is easily done with the stupid, manipulated and afraid. Trust this, that lot will be the first ones to bend over and give Hitler their guns when asked lol!"
"The GOP (Grand Old Pricks) still haven’t the guts nor the integrity to throw the book at that racist Drumpf with hundreds of dog whistles hanging around his neck; decorations for America’s modern-day Dr. Strange-glove (between a woman’s legs), a man with Nazi DNA in his blood, a stupid, stupid little man, because the GOP is a racist party. This madman with intent bordering on psychosis and steeped in his appalling hatred for African Americans and anyone who isn't white attested by his long history of racist bullying, who will do anything to tear to shreds the the many advances left by his predecessor, Barack Obama.  To those who have normalized Drumpf over the past two years and more, you’ve made your bed and now you must sleep in it."

Neither Hillary or Donald got our nation's interest at heart. They are both in it for themselves. Pair of greedy leeches and no matter who win, we Americans will lose. In one of my other comments, I asked....endorsing any of the two candidates is like picking who you like better....Hitler or Stalin. But regardless, we got people picking Hitler over Stalin or Stalin over Hitler, just like this old retiring politician like Warner.

Do these people think their down right stupid and worthless statements mean anything.  They are just adding to the chorus of the ANTIFA, Resistance and other sore losers that don't have a life or don't have jobs. How stupid has the Democratic Party become to fail to realize that throwing everything under the bus leaves them with no credibility?  Working class Americans, blue collar workers, unionized workers, middle class workers, Christians, minorities, legal aliens, legal immigrants and the myriad others that were the base of the Democratic Party are now shunned and vilified by the elected and appointed Democratic politicians.  Their shill creed is becoming the white noise on the 24/7 news cycle and quickly becoming irrelevant."
"This is b.s. She should do her research before shooting her mouth off. There are videos of Trump acting the same way while talking about other people who are not disabled. Also, you can see video of this reporter talking and he does not wave his hands like that. So Trump was not mocking his disability, his issue was with what the reporter SAID. But the media puts something like this out there and a whole lot of stupid people just buy it. Kind of scary, actually. And who cares what Meryl Streep says, anyway?"

"More manufactured fake news. First, Trump is not the founding father of the white supremacists despite all the media's attempt to make it look like he is, and that's ignorance. Second, his two day delay to condemn that group has to do with waiting for the facts to come out, and not because he supports them. The leftist media jumped the gun on several occasions, and many people paid the price for it with their jobs gone, but the fools never learn. Trump is an outsider, the establishment hates him -most Democrats and some Republicans because they liked their comfy business as usual positions to ruin our country."

"I would rather work with a Hillary supporter than a Trump supporter any day. Trump is a proven racist and misogynist.

Examples for the weak minded who forget too easily (or just don't care):

Racist = pointing to one of the only black people at his rally and stating something along the lines of ""Here is my black guy""; asking the a black reporter if she knows the Black Caucus in DC and if she can set up a meeting between he and them.

Misogynist = bragging about sexually assaulting women and then stating that this was only ""locker room banter"".

Please defend any of these statements if you can. However, first place yourself in a black person's or woman's shoes and ask yourself how you would feel if either of these examples happened to you. The irrational out there, will likely state that this is not a problem and would be OK or even proud that Trump would show some attention to them. The rest of us understand that the Idiot in Chief is just that and his supporters are much the same."

"Low-IQ Donald figured out one clever thing:  If you can have a very loyal 30-something percent base, you have a chance to compete in most any election.  All it took was a few Hillary careless errors and the Russian fake news campaign to get him into the White House.

The Republican senators and reps saw what happened, and now they're afraid to fight Trump and his base.  The proof is in the few who are retiring (McCain, Flake, Collins, etc.); having nothing to lose, they ALL say what an idiot he is.

But now that he's done little to help America, especially the undereducated whites who voted him in, that 30-something percent will not be enough next time--if there is a next time."

"Bernstein doesn't hate Trump as much as he hates white Christians and Trump's followers, but he's afraid to say so.

His kooky, insane ideas belong in a grade school classroom.  Personally I'd like to see him culled from the population by jailing him as a national security threat.  He's a worthless fool."

Scum finds scum, and he is surrounded by a cess pool of his own type..scum.  Finally, he is every day being subject to real scrutiny....and my prediction is a man of such low character cannot and will not survive the scrutiny that comes with the office he has astonishingly achieved."

Seems Trump voters are eager to return Alaska to full colony status, where we are only good for supplying the rest of the United states - and other countries - with our resources, for which we get little to nothing. Then when Alaska has been sucked dry by outside interests, we’ll be left with the ugly, broken, empty shell.  And who’s helping to do this? Our very own senators, legislators and Mallot, both of whom expect to get rewarded handsomely.  
Of course, the very same morons who voted for Trump also voted for the Republicans Gand semi-blue idiots who voted for Mallot.  These Alaskans - if you can them that - have no pride or backbone. They are pigs at the trough of our destruction. For shame."

A liberal liar-to-Congress who's trying to sabotage a huge amount of business intended to ensure that we'll all have fuel for our vehicles in the future. Exxon is one of the biggest players in Russia, but then there are all the leaders in horizontal-drilling. Russia is a huge producer, and by far the largest oil resource in the world is the Bazhenov formation.

Given our lack of presence in the North, the Globe should refrain from stirring up hatred that could come back to bite us.

"This clown Bishop McElroy along with quite a few others apparently, just doesn't get it:  A Muslim's primary purpose in life to to exterminate Christians, or anyone else who doesn't think like them.  Sweden is now the rape capitol of Europe and second in the world in rapes per capita, all thanks to the Muslim invaders.  They don't think like we do.  They do not share our values.  They have no respect for women, the environment, animals, or human life.  McElroy is naive and a fool.  Hopefully Darwins principle removes him from the picture because what he preaches is cultural and religious suicide.  A war is coming over the fate of the earth - Islam or Christianity.  We all need to pick which side we want to be on and quit consorting with the enemy."
"And they can be taken to task for it as Republican President Ford was when he pardoned Nixon.  Of course at that time voters were more ethical, moral and sane, recognized corruption, and so vote lost his re-election bid. Now we have Trump's base, a constituency that doesn't know what those words mean and could care less that Trump is at best a corrupt loser and at worse a traitor."

"Wrong... what is malignant is the media.  What the media is doing is taking sides against half the country who believe what Trump is doing is the right thing and it is bias schmucks like you in the media that are part of the problem not part of the cure.  

In fact for decades now you have declared war against the average working man/woman because you think YOU are enlightened and that the citizenry are too stupid to manage their our own lives... that YOU and big brother govt knows best.   

So thanks but no thanks asking for our help in destroying Trump... we plan on destroying the scum in the media instead."
"He's dangerous, not because he's an idiot but because he doesn't have the best interests of the US at heart but his own self interest. He's also dangerous, because some of his supporters are armed, dangerous and willing to start a violent revolt if they don't win."

"What a load of crap! It astounds me that someone of this author's stature would go by the word of people who write for the NYT, that is known for peddling Putin bashing fake news. If Putin was such a tyrant and a strong arm dictator why would his ratings be the highest of ANY statesman currently AND is widely popular with his fellow compatriots?
Also, the Crimea wasn't ""annexed"" but was legally taken back through an internatinally recognised referendum where 95% of the population voted to be incorporated back into the Russian Federatoon. If this author had done her research properly she would have known this and  discovered other real facts of the Russian Leader.  She selectively picks negative moments about Putin from the Oliver Stone interviews for the purposes of this article to fit her story in comparison to JZ the idiot. Had she done her homework properly she would also have learnt, thanks to Putin, that European and Asian countries are joining the SCO to improve trade relations."
"Betcha ten bucks that many of these victimized white men also scoffed at the #MeToo protest that is going on to highlight sexual harassment.

Well that's a comment straight out of a Trump Rally.  Even I saw that one on the news.  Try to think like a big boy and come up with an original comment so we don't have to keep calling you an idiot.
"Kasich should talk - he went around HIS statehouse and accepted the Medicaid expansion like an idiot.  Then had a hissy fit because Trump beat him.  He's like McCain and Graham, the alt-left media always go to him when they want ""... and Republicans agree with the left's lies..."" quotes."

Trump is a bold-faced liar and a pure-bred racist. He is no better than a bonafide member of the Ku Klux Klan. He is probably a full-fledged mebmer of the White Nationalists. Trump is a disgrace and an enemy of America. He needs to be impeached.

Walmart pays its average employee close to minimum wage.  As a result, the beneficiaries of Walmart's recent Thanksgiving charity drive to feed the hungry included its own employees.  Maintaining the current minimum wage means that homelessness will increase, as there are homeless families whose adult members are working, but are not making enough to pay rent. On the other hand, Costco has proven that it's possible for big box stores to pay much more, as it pays its average employee $20 an hour.  That should be the minimum expectation for all workers in the most prosperous country on earth."

Even while Obama investigated and illegally surveilled some media members the bulk of these creeps still supported his criminal activities and utilization of government agencies to batter his political opponents.

He and his crew were the  worst criminals ever to occupy the W.H.  History will not be kind to Obama when the research and exposures are written.  He took advice from a known slumlord and crooked operator.

What jokes the republicans  have become.  

I realize the Donald will never show us his tax returns as then he will be shown to be the fraud he is.  But since he complained about Obama's birth certificate, I can complain about his tax returns.  I could be demanding to see his birth certificate to prove his father was not an Orangutan"

Dotard said that ""healthcare would be easy"" (how's that ""repeal & replace"" coming along?), Dotard also said reining in the N Korean's would be easy also but after meeting with Xi Jinping said “After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it’s not so easy,”. Dotard also said that building the wall that Mexico would pay for was going to be easy. How's that wall coming along? Then just today he said ""he would not rest until Puerto Rican's are safe"" as he boarded Air Force One for yet another taxpayer paid for golf trip (24th or 25th golf trip?) to his club in New Jersey.

"""I have no idea what to say in rational response to such an extreme (and I might add, insulting to at least half the nation) take on the election success of the president elect.""

Really, utilitas?   Trump didn't get the support of over half the nation.  He finished second in the popular vote, and over 100 million voters didn't vote out of either indifference or Republican voter suppression.  Considering that the president-elect is a lying, misogynist, racist ignoramus who is including neo-Nazis in his inner circle, perhaps those voters who voted for him deserve to be insulted."

He was not just a ""N#$%$#"", he was a ""N$#%$"" who wasn't even born in America.""  

We now have a GOP Presidential candidate who openly parades his racism and xenophobia..and his followers love it.  

I ask myself, ""can we really elect such a man to be our President?""  Is the hatred and bogotry Mr. Trump's actions and comments have disclosed really OK with a majority of American voters?
Do those who approve and support such a view really represent today's America?

"WHY does it have to go to ala moana ?  This state is insane, they would not lose ridership, only current bus riders will be on the stupid thing anyway."
I thought that Bannon was scary but it turns out he is a moron.  The bishops should send him a fruit basket for making them look good.  It is the first time in ages that they have gotten good publicity from the press and lots of kudos from the public.
"In order to be funny you need a fool to ridicule.
No matter how much you hated Obama and his politics he didn't run around hiring fools and saying moronic crap like Trump and Bush..."

Two lives wasted for the most idiotic reason possible.
"motley:  There is NO question HE is an OLD FOOL, and OLD Druggie.    In his mind, HE is supplying a 25 year old woman with METH, and getting that young woman Bang Job, just what ALL of us OLD guys fantasize about, right????   Both these people need Drug Intervention and Mental Illness Intervention."
"LOL, Captain Crayons,, hilarious! Will this moron from the land of unicorns and rainbows ever stop earning uncomplimentary nicknames"
"Right. A racist, sexist, bigoted, adulterous liar of a president should be supported, and those who voted for him praised.

Previous conservative presidents at least gave lip service to their Christianity. Do you really see Trump doing even that?"
"educated adults should just laugh and feel sorry for the pathetic brain washed ignorant sheep like you , you are as close we come to a clown these days!,,"
"Does this nutcase not realize how many people died on 9/11? Does she really think her losing the Pres election equates to that many lives being lost? Rather than blame Russia, Comey, Bernie, etc., why doesn't she just ask those of us who voted for Obama but not her why we didn't vote for her. She will hear about a lack of accomplishment, bad decisions, the Clinton Foundation, the arrogance, the corruption. She will hear many of us made our minds up the day she forced herself, I mean announced her candidacy. She ran a horrible campaign. We saw it. We lived through it. She makes herself look foolish when she offers these lame untrue excuses."
"Idiot isn't it, ben w?"
that goal is pure alt left stupidity brain washing bs
"Assuming the ""everyday Americans"" being referred to are these same idiots and racists that support Trump, I'd say Hillary is definitely not alone in hating such people. Anyone with a minimum of intelligence and personal dignity is offended by these cretins who make all Americans look backward and mentally deficient. 
It really depends on how you define ""everyday Americans"" and if you look at Hillary's platform, that is, the policies she has stated on record that she intends to pursue when she becomes president, I say, I don't care who someone said they think Hillary hates as long as she actually tries to implement the non-rich people-friendly policies she has crafted in her policy statements. 
Seriously, what's the option--voting for Republicans? These people are always saying how much they love average Americans while they stab them in the back supporting policies that favor only the rich. The policies favored by Republicans are a matter of public record."
"At least you and the Nazis have the same ideas. Congratulations, you are human scum."
"I read every comment about all of you on multiple websites, you have to be stupid to think people don't."
"This donation won't help a bit with tuition, so you are right. But the scale of the problem is a little daunting. UO has 25,000 students, so if this donation were to be used to help reduce tuition, it would drop tuition by $280 per student for one term this year and then be gone. That's a tough sell to a donor. It could also be made into an endowment to help reduce tuition forever... by $3.50 a term per student!"
"only the ignorant left thing trump is a disaster when its the congress so far, trump is doing pretty good over all getting much done"
How did all these people have such stupid attorneys. That's who they should sue. There is no science behind the claim to begin with.
Bobby Hammons you unbelievable scumbag. If anyone has drug money they are protecting that's Jeffrey Keebler Elf Leprechaun Sessions. He is a puppet of Big Pharma and Tobacco.

Carl Bernstein is known as a malicious left-wing schmuck.
"Yeah.  Terrible few days for the Democrats (again).  

First there was the Inauguration of a narcissist, racist, misogynist.  Then the eventual, but quick reveals (on almost a daily basis) that he's also unable to do the ""deals"" he promised, not only a racist but a White Supremacist (the worst kind of racist), ripping off the Federal Government allowing his subordinates to do so, an idiot who doesn't understand what he's talking about, an international provocateur who appears to WANT nuclear war, etc., etc., etc.

THEN, this.  One of the guys who was supposed to give us confidence that the bundle of severe deficiencies and disorders occupying the seat of President would be balanced by someone of cooler temperament, intelligence and unquestionable character.

The horror.  Kelly is either a liar or incompetent.  

Now, I'm really scared.  

And, I wonder what the military has done in the past that Kelly has either lied about or covered up. . . ."
"The left calls for Trump to be assassinated, to blow up the White House, say that Trump is Hitlerian, a racist, sexist, homophobic, idiotic con man. 
Trump says Crazy Bernie, Crooked Hillary, Low IQ Mika, Psycho Joe, Low energy Jeb, Elizabeth Pocohantas, Lyin Ted.
He insults and they insult. There is no indication in the above insults that he treats women any differently."
"well patuk , guess what, your hero hillbilly will soon be under inditement. meanwhile, trump is trying to clean up the country of ner do wells. with a name like patuk, i suspect you are one of the jerks he will kick out soon."
"The funniest part of all this is that it only confirms just how stupid Kaneshiro is -- that he didn't see this POS story he told -- meant to help cover up for Katherine Kealoha -- coming back on him at some point in the future.

"Your show of racism proves the cliche about when fool open their mouthes.
Eight years, hahahahaha the man with the yellow possum oh his head won't last 2 years."
"But that gives ""clueless moron"" a bad reputation. Charlie is far worse; he's crooked (and proud of it)."
"Sure. I guess Trump forced this fool to act like a criminal. He looks like a homeless guy that needs a job. If it was my kid, regardless of political position, I would give him a crack upside his head. I guess I'm just a big old square."
"What a stupid, useless graphic.  Which neighbourhoods are which?"
Play stupid games and win Hollow point prizes .
Hopefully the republican establishment can keep Trump and Bannon in check and the sooner the better. Clearly things have to change and change fast before this buffoon gets us into a world war or causes another depression.

"I noticed that Brad Trost’s wife Gerelt, who is from Mongolia, wrote a letter to the Globe, protesting her husband being called a racist by Knox. He obviously doesn’t have anything against Asians. 
Bill Clinton was the only president of the US whose penis was described in court proceedings while he was in office,  possibly the only leader of any country. Really hard to fathom why Knox would have wanted to give this vicious, sexual predator and his rebarbative slut-shaming wife a third term in the White House. Thank God she and her accomplices didn’t succeed."
"Mr. Trump is a psychotic.  He cannot be removed from office soon enough.

He is a disgrace to the United States."

Hilarious.......stupid but hilarious!!!!
You wish trumps a fool.
"Hey dummy, he isn't Scottie."
Very apropos of CNN's typical coverage of the news.
"Sure Lazee. Continue to rationalize your support of an idiotic demagogue with paper-thin excuses about ""dumping a lifelong politician"". Intelligent observers saw the differences between Clinton and Trump quite clearly with Clinton being a competent establishment candidate with clearly defined policy initiatives, and Trump being a thin-skinned megalomaniac in far over his head with aggressively bad policy proposals, where he bothered to come up with any, that is. Of course, no one has accused you of being an intelligent observer, have they?"
"Trump has been around this long only because he’s a white guy with tons of white privilege. He should have been gone a long time ago, especially after screaming “tell ‘em to go f**k themselves” at a campaign and bragging about being able to grab women by their pu**y because he’s rich and famous."
"This man sounds insane, totally lost it, classic case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. What could he possibly be thinking of to make such outrageous and ridiculous claims about the president? Does he have no clue as to how he looks and sounds when he is saying such patently false things? Does he think the American people are so stupid as to believe anything he is saying? Buy a vowel, a majority of Americans were not impressed and didn't support his efforts against President Nixon. Hounding a legitimately elected president out of office is nothing to be proud of, Carl Bernstein has not improved with age. He is still the same arrogant a-hole he has always been in the past."
"There was no chemical weapons attack ""by"" Damascus, you dirty old liar."
"Whites never learn....you're making enemies with the world - Blacks (lives matter/cops killing innocent blacks), Browns (destroying entire region and creating chaos), Slav Russians (yeah, anglos dont really consider them part of their own, so...), Yellow (sending the navy as potential ""PREEMPTIVE"" strike; not allow China to take uninhabited atols, when white STOLE and KILLED other of their land).
Whites should enslave all blacks in America or send them back to Africa (on the way throw them oveboard), Nuke the crap out of Middel East and keep their Oil. Nuke the Crap out of Yellow peril so you can not only have the Pacific Ocean as your backyard, you can have the Yellowman's backyard as well!"
"Hopefully, whoever was running this ""ed-venture"" chastised the idiot for harassing the goat.  Another example of human stupidity in the face of pure grace and beauty."

From the same fools who would have us double military expenditures while denying climate change.  Typical.
These rating probably aren't even right. Cry babies just want to try make it seem like they are making a difference. None of the players are kneeling to disrespect the flag or america. Do any of you idiots out there that want the nfl banned. Think about all the players who all ways stand and the players who have served before. The ones that help their communities and other charities. Want the nfl banned for the few players kneeling. When is probably less than 1% of the nfl kneeling. But you idiots think justice is nfl getting banned and all the players being out the job. Just seem so selfish and greedy that some people want that. Fuck all the players that stand that have served and that help out alot. They should all be out the job for the few the many shall pay. But of course greed is the american way.

"Cory Gardner has some work to do, however he is 100% right on this. I can't understand why anyone would have a problem with this statement unless they subscribe to the same beliefs as the domestic terrorists who have the blood of Heather Heyer on their hands.

I give to select charities now : Salvation Army, St. Vincents,  Red Cross.
Consider that most donors with money to give are paying more taxes, I think some charities are not surprisingly in trouble."

Why is he the worst attending PM in the House of Commons in recent history? Because he can't speak off the top of his head in Question Period and struggles without rehearsed lines so the Liberals purposefully find reasons for him to leave Canada."

"Chris, my intent was  to back up that line with the explanation of the Supreme Court rulings later in the column, which effectively limit campaign finance laws to stopping quid pro quo corruption, which many interpret as an explicit exchange of a donation for a particular vote. By defining corruption so narrowly, the court said it is almost impossible, and by saying the public has a right to regulate campaigns only to fit that narrow definition, it said that very little concern about public integrity is justified."
"Wow.....the Bush peoples are fake?  Darn......I wanted to leave from Maine and go to Alaska so I could rub dirt on myself and climb trees, and get a deal on a 5 K WWII mine sweeper for delivering a crappy front end of a 1935 buick made into a desk.  Everyone knows that these things are not in the lower 48.   I have now changed my mind and want to homestead in VA so I can just crap wherever I feel like, with the pigs, and have some dude with a cowboy hat wearing a dress shirt tell me how and where to crap in an outhouse I really don't need (being a stupid city slicker...arf arf)."

No actually. They will sit down like any other woman. Stop being ignorant
"Vintage Trump SOP.  Make an idiotic, provocative statement (or present an idiotic, provocative tax 'plan' in this case) and watch the talking heads go berserk bashing, defending, and debating it.  Meanwhile, all eyes are turned away from his incredibly inept performance and collusion with Russia.  
When will the media ever learn?  Answer: Never.  Thus it is incumbent upon all of us to discriminate between real issues and Trump alt-issues."
Trmplethinskin is a narcissistic sociopath with visions of dictatorship dancing though his orange locks.
"Trump is just playing to his base. You know the deal.  Black celebrities can and admirably do bring racism to the public focus. Trump is playing to the bigoted idiots that liked his 7 years of ""birther"" horse excrement. He gets em all fired up over nothing, pretends he is all presidential, tweets his brains out. Next day its some other trivial attention seeking headline. Tired of winning already!"
"I don't know.  Folks in Nevada are pretty stupid and ignorant, from what I have experienced with them.  Their school system has been a wreck for decades, just like Oregon's.   Plus they have a very transient population, with a lot of Casino workers.    Much of the population is very low class.    Tobacco, alcohol, and drug use are all very high.  Jurors should be far less sophisticated and intelligent, compared to a jury from Portland.

Let's hope that the Federal Prosecutors in Las Vegas do indeed do a better job."

"Ok, you say Fox news and Breitbat don't tell the truth. So,I went back and watch Trumps press conference. Here were is exact words: The KKK, white supremacist and the Neo nazis are repungnant and violence has no place in this country. Yet, the left and the braindead media, CNN, ABC MSNBC, all lied and said Trump likes the KKK. So, there you go, just caught you and every news media except Fox lying thru your teeth like only scumbags can do."
"Your 6-3 decision came from the MSM sloptrough. Try pulling your head out and take the time to look it up. You ""losers"" can learn something. October the SCOTUS will hear arguments. The vote was a 9-0 slap in the face for you clowns. So get over it."

"There are many who idiotically point to Bill Clinton. 
First, do not try to excuse Trump’s bad behavior with Clinton’s behavior, that is what children do.

I was not a fan of Bill Clinton and I am not a democrat. Bill Clinton received deferments just like Trump did.
Bill Clinton was eligible for the draft in 1969. Trump was never eligible.

Trump is a draft dodging coward. 
Clinton was a draft eligible weasel.

The only people you are hurting with your stupid boycott are the people who work at the NETWORKS, the NFL will be just fine. Read it and weep , MORONS. 

Until the broadcast contract ended in 2013, the terrestrial television networks CBS ($3.73B), NBC ($3.6B) and Fox ($4.27B) — as well as cable television's ESPN ($8.8B) — paid a combined total of US$20.4 billion to broadcast NFL games.

I`m retired and I`ll pay my fair share of income taxes, like good citizens do in other states to keep infrastructure, schools and maintenance and public services up to snuff.  If my state and it`s citizens don`t want a proud university and k-12 education system, with 70 billion dollars available to ""draw on"" to help keep taxes low STILL, while maintaining the quality of education we all hope for,,.. then we are letting our own society and it`s binding fabric down. (even reinstating a state income tax would make us the second lowest income or sales- taxing state in the union..)."

"The Republican Party is tripping over themselves trying to distance themselves from the Alt Right. It's all lip service. The Aryan Nation Party (GOP) pitched a hissy fit when the Obama administration tried to put white supremacist groups on the terrorists watch list. It is the their white trash president that for more than eight years demanded to see President Obama's birth certificate. It was their white trash congress that obstructed at every turn, even denying President Obama's Supreme Court nominee for nearly a year. It was because he was the first Black President. No the Republican / Aryan Nation Party owns this. No amount of lip service will suffice. It is time to call out the entire party.

Uh? Harper delivered 6 straight deficits including a record $56 billion in 2009-10. He lowered the HST lowered taxes and wiped out in no time flat a huge surplus he inherited from the Liberals.

And have you noticed that the monthly Federal deficits have gradually been creeping up.  now they're at 3.3 billion for a single month. If you have the slightest idea how a federal government constructs its finances you would grasp that it is the trend that kills.  Your pal Trudeau campaigned on the basis of 10 billion dollar deficits for a few years... The finance department itself has said we will see deficit till 2050. Canadian banks are forecasting deficits 35 to 40 billion dollars and we're now well on the way to achieving them.

Now, could you tell us where exactly is all that infrastructure that Trudeau promised? Projects aren't even on the drawing board and he's already spewing cash off the back of the truck. Liberal  bag of fools"

No, the govt. did not have the power per Article 1, Section 8 to use that tax $$$ for O-Care.  Again, even if it did, it would be wrong for it to do so.

Immigration can only maintain the confidence of the populace if you properly extreme vet and only allow in people who make the country better.   The absolute test must be ""does this persons presence make Canada (or other jurisdiction) a better place than it is without them""?

Unfortunately the answer is often a no ... and we let them in anyways ... and then act surprised when they slaughter our citizenry or abuse our social safety nets or spread their religious hatred to others.  

Foolish but predictable ....  liberals and democrats open your eyes please."

They're thinking that all they have to do is press some of the answers and they can leave."

What we as a voting public need to keep in mind through these statements or mea culpa's, or whatever they're supposed to be, is that the ""press"", and the media in general is still owned by a mere handful of people, and that handful is primarily interested in keeping the money coming in, in that giant bonanza we refer to as an election ""year.""  They might not even be here in this age of the internet if not for the huge amounts campaign cash that have come to define election cycles, and politics in general."

Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.

In many cases, it is now often possible to make and defend quantitative statements about the extent to which human-induced climate change (or another causal factor, such as a specific mode of natural variability) has influenced either the magnitude or the probability of occurrence of specific types of events or event classes."""

Stop being ignorant and lazy and try reading a bit about it.
The university could have attempted such a ban if they wanted to have one (though it would have failed in any legal test it faced).  The city touted using the money for all sorts of 'good health and wellness programs' for its residents including several areas right near the university.  Unsurprisingly the city also targeted the area around the University in its efforts to get the tax approved.   Basically the sales job amounted to you will get all these things and someone else will pay for them.  Now it turns out that those students that were so stoked to get all that free stuff that someone else would pay for... will be paying for all that free stuff elsewhere in the city.  The university makes up 25% of the total tax to be collected.  So rather than being the recipients of 'other peoples money' they are instead the 'other people' paying for all the projects elsewhere in the city.

"The increasing use of online education means that some of the smaller campuses are no longer needed. These campuses typically have very limited course choice, and thus stream students into programs that they may not want or the community may not need. Where programs need hands-on experience (auto mechanics, for instance) students will have to leave communities that can't support reasonable enrollment. That might require student aid to provide grants rather than loans to students in remote communities. It is still likely that there will be net savings and improved education quality."

"The author's assumptions about spending by retired baby boomers are off-base. Just because they know how to spend money doesn't mean they will continue to do so once retired. When retirees in their 60s (like me) are faced with fixed costs like property taxes and condominium fees  that are rising faster than their pension incomes do, naturally they will tend to reduce variable expenses wherever they can. Many others are falling back mainly on their savings (RRSPs and other) to fund their retirements, are searching desperately for better investment yields and don't have indexed pensions apart from CPP and OAS. Carrick should speak with some financial advisers who actually deal with retirees in their 60s - he might learn something from them."

Louise d'Epinay  hosted an enlightened salon and was partner of Melchoir Grimm. She offered  J.J Rousseau a cottage on her estate as his home. Most of all she wrote numerous books and wrote many famous letters to the Abbe Galiani expressing many of the values we now identify and aspire to.

"Trump is a Machiavellian type, which means that there is probably some dark purpose behind even his dumbest moves. This so called clown did defeat the best strategy the Dems had to offer, and they're pretty tricky their own selves. He also conned almost half of America to vote for him. Is it possible that Trump isn't as stupid as his opponents would want to believe?

Trump's latest actions could possibly lure Russia's interests to the west; so that in case of a war between America and China, Russia will be too far out of position, and preoccupied enough, so that Russia won't side with China?

Listen to the bulk of rhetoric ... almost all directed at N. Korea being an existential threat to America.

Our government is clearing the field for battle, and their first move is to pull Russia away from China.

We have the capability to pull a ""First-Strike"" against China, but not Russia and China simultaneously. Plus, without Russia's backing, China will probably wuss out."

"Word limitations for the opinion piece did not allow me to provide all of the information required to prove the points I was trying to make. There is no objective study done anywhere in Canada, at any time, that has shown that fees for dental work in AB is 50% higher than somewhere else, for the exact same treatment, codes, etc. The experience of one person (or 10) is not statistically valid.
Expenses in a dental practice are simple? No more simple than other small businesses...and in todays regulatory environment (radiation, infection control, security, privacy, and more) that is more onerous in AB than other provinces adds greatly to our expenses.
Bottom line...a fee guide will not solve that problem."

Why lay off Alaska's oil workers when they are drilling for the next 40 years of free Permanent fund money for you!

Why not enjoy more Permanent Fund money and let the oil workers of Alaska produce another 19 Billion barrels and 8 Trillion Cubic Feet of Gas and allow these incentives and earned credits keep finding new oil!

"One thing that I don't see in any press on this subject is the impact of a big minimum wage hike on the cost of child care.  Lots of child care workers earn a lot less than $13/hour.  I think all child care workers are undervalued and should earn far more than they do, but I don't know many families who can afford to pay significantly more for child care. Infant care in a center costs around $1200 a month now.  A big wage hike would push that cost up by hundreds of dollars a month, as the biggest expense most child care centers have is wages.  I think we'll see a lot of mothers pushed out of the labor force by the jump in child care costs.  Combine the loss of an income with generally higher costs for goods and services, and this minimum wage hike will hit middle class families hard.   I have yet to see Kotek or anyone else explain how families are going to manage the increased cost of child care, and I haven't seen anyone in the press ask them to."

"Cut any pipes sticking up down another foot to ground level so they are not a hazard and take care of the other issues which seem minor, but should be taken care of.  It's unfortunate this mine on lands the feds gave to the state for development was stopped from going through the permit process by one EPA employee with a personal environmental agenda, Phil North.  (Unlike Hillary, Phil was smart enough after corrupting the permit process and destroying his emails to flee the United States before he could be charged with multiple felonies for destroying official federal records) Not sure if the mine would have made it through the permitting process but if it did, the $1 billion a year in royalties and taxes to the State would have preserved the full permanent fund dividend payment for all Alaskans and sent another $400 million to the treasury for medicaid, education, and payments to seniors.  Not to mention providing thousands of $100,000 a year jobs for locals with no jobs now."

I think the Greens are reading too much into this win.  Many people like me voted Green because of the extreme corporate bias of the Liberals and on the other hand the undue influence of big labour on the NDP.  Anyone not aligned with these camps goes unrepresented. Andrew Weaver promised he would look at each situation and use an evidence based approach in making decisions.  That should have translated into taking the most rational and progressive portions of any issue. Unfortunately after the election the big lobby groups in the environment and labour pulled out all the stops and we instead have an NDP/Green alliance.   The pundits are underestimating the numbers who voted for the Greens out of protest of the other parties and the promise to shine a light on the business of government.

That was shameful on his part given how many have died on that section of road.   A cement center line divider would save countless lives .

It would be a greater value for me to know simply how much they give to charity. Which is always one of the big talking points of a candidate.  The tax return of the first member of the Romney family to run for president were the first ones released during a campaign. It was a publicity stunt that saw little scrutiny by voters or the press. Today a candidates tax return is a blood sport. In reality have any of these tax returns ever actually undergo a conclusive investigation proving they are the full and complete final filings.  NO.

I've seen enough bogus tax returns to know it is not complicated to produce one with whatever you want it to say.  The IRS does not care what you put out to the public. It is only concerned with what you actuly submit to them. Ask your banker if they ever see false returns used to qualify for a loan."

It would certainly be that equities are dangerous, dividends can be reduced by the company and I will lose money.

"SD,  I read a while back that an advocate of Measure 97 said Oregonians will pay $2.00 for every $1.00 of ""free"" money.  I see you're still trying to figure out how many businesses will pass this tax on and how many won't.  My assumption is there is some number you are looking for that will swing your vote one way or the other.

Maybe this thought can help.  It isn't how many total companies but how many WILL pass the tax on to the poor thru lower middle class.  The poor won't or can't buy I-pads (optional for the more well to do.) and things like that  But the poor have to buy gas, food, and insurance.  They also have to pay utility bills.  I'm sure PacifiCorp (electricity), Portland General Electric, NW Natural Gas, CenturyLink, and all cell phone providers, et al. will easily pass the minimum threshold for the tax to kick in.  My guess is most public utilities like EWEB and SUB will also hit the minimum threshold.  These companies will all easily pass the tax on.  Does this help?"
