"Trump pulled Gillespie down into the cesspool, but the voters of Virginia have obviously had more than their fill of Trump.

"It's the same everywhere, not just the US. Yet Trump and his ilk expect the world to bow to them and give the rest of us the short end of the stick. His tariff talks will create trade wars and make everything very expensive in the US. Does he really think no one will stand up to these threats? He's all about him and how no one else in the entire world is of the same caliber or worth (and I don't mean $$$-wise). Me, me,me, I,I,I.

It's all there. But you're blinded by partisanship."

They don't think about wether it's the right person, the right to a defense etc.. They are like a bunch of junk yard dogs. It's almost amusing how Trump manipulated them to gain power isn't it? These people have no thought process in regard to their condemnation. I guess the Middle East won after all because these idiots gave them their way. Divide and conquer is easily done with the stupid, manipulated and afraid. Trust this, that lot will be the first ones to bend over and give Hitler their guns when asked lol!"
"The GOP (Grand Old Pricks) still haven’t the guts nor the integrity to throw the book at that racist Drumpf with hundreds of dog whistles hanging around his neck; decorations for America’s modern-day Dr. Strange-glove (between a woman’s legs), a man with Nazi DNA in his blood, a stupid, stupid little man, because the GOP is a racist party. This madman with intent bordering on psychosis and steeped in his appalling hatred for African Americans and anyone who isn't white attested by his long history of racist bullying, who will do anything to tear to shreds the the many advances left by his predecessor, Barack Obama.  To those who have normalized Drumpf over the past two years and more, you’ve made your bed and now you must sleep in it."

Neither Hillary or Donald got our nation's interest at heart. They are both in it for themselves. Pair of greedy leeches and no matter who win, we Americans will lose. In one of my other comments, I asked....endorsing any of the two candidates is like picking who you like better....Hitler or Stalin. But regardless, we got people picking Hitler over Stalin or Stalin over Hitler, just like this old retiring politician like Warner.

Do these people think their down right stupid and worthless statements mean anything.  They are just adding to the chorus of the ANTIFA, Resistance and other sore losers that don't have a life or don't have jobs. How stupid has the Democratic Party become to fail to realize that throwing everything under the bus leaves them with no credibility?  Working class Americans, blue collar workers, unionized workers, middle class workers, Christians, minorities, legal aliens, legal immigrants and the myriad others that were the base of the Democratic Party are now shunned and vilified by the elected and appointed Democratic politicians.  Their shill creed is becoming the white noise on the 24/7 news cycle and quickly becoming irrelevant."
"This is b.s. She should do her research before shooting her mouth off. There are videos of Trump acting the same way while talking about other people who are not disabled. Also, you can see video of this reporter talking and he does not wave his hands like that. So Trump was not mocking his disability, his issue was with what the reporter SAID. But the media puts something like this out there and a whole lot of stupid people just buy it. Kind of scary, actually. And who cares what Meryl Streep says, anyway?"

"More manufactured fake news. First, Trump is not the founding father of the white supremacists despite all the media's attempt to make it look like he is, and that's ignorance. Second, his two day delay to condemn that group has to do with waiting for the facts to come out, and not because he supports them. The leftist media jumped the gun on several occasions, and many people paid the price for it with their jobs gone, but the fools never learn. Trump is an outsider, the establishment hates him -most Democrats and some Republicans because they liked their comfy business as usual positions to ruin our country."

"I would rather work with a Hillary supporter than a Trump supporter any day. Trump is a proven racist and misogynist.

Examples for the weak minded who forget too easily (or just don't care):

Racist = pointing to one of the only black people at his rally and stating something along the lines of ""Here is my black guy""; asking the a black reporter if she knows the Black Caucus in DC and if she can set up a meeting between he and them.

Misogynist = bragging about sexually assaulting women and then stating that this was only ""locker room banter"".

Please defend any of these statements if you can. However, first place yourself in a black person's or woman's shoes and ask yourself how you would feel if either of these examples happened to you. The irrational out there, will likely state that this is not a problem and would be OK or even proud that Trump would show some attention to them. The rest of us understand that the Idiot in Chief is just that and his supporters are much the same."

"Low-IQ Donald figured out one clever thing:  If you can have a very loyal 30-something percent base, you have a chance to compete in most any election.  All it took was a few Hillary careless errors and the Russian fake news campaign to get him into the White House.

The Republican senators and reps saw what happened, and now they're afraid to fight Trump and his base.  The proof is in the few who are retiring (McCain, Flake, Collins, etc.); having nothing to lose, they ALL say what an idiot he is.

But now that he's done little to help America, especially the undereducated whites who voted him in, that 30-something percent will not be enough next time--if there is a next time."

"Bernstein doesn't hate Trump as much as he hates white Christians and Trump's followers, but he's afraid to say so.

His kooky, insane ideas belong in a grade school classroom.  Personally I'd like to see him culled from the population by jailing him as a national security threat.  He's a worthless fool."

Scum finds scum, and he is surrounded by a cess pool of his own type..scum.  Finally, he is every day being subject to real scrutiny....and my prediction is a man of such low character cannot and will not survive the scrutiny that comes with the office he has astonishingly achieved."

Seems Trump voters are eager to return Alaska to full colony status, where we are only good for supplying the rest of the United states - and other countries - with our resources, for which we get little to nothing. Then when Alaska has been sucked dry by outside interests, we’ll be left with the ugly, broken, empty shell.  And who’s helping to do this? Our very own senators, legislators and Mallot, both of whom expect to get rewarded handsomely.  
Of course, the very same morons who voted for Trump also voted for the Republicans Gand semi-blue idiots who voted for Mallot.  These Alaskans - if you can them that - have no pride or backbone. They are pigs at the trough of our destruction. For shame."

A liberal liar-to-Congress who's trying to sabotage a huge amount of business intended to ensure that we'll all have fuel for our vehicles in the future. Exxon is one of the biggest players in Russia, but then there are all the leaders in horizontal-drilling. Russia is a huge producer, and by far the largest oil resource in the world is the Bazhenov formation.

Given our lack of presence in the North, the Globe should refrain from stirring up hatred that could come back to bite us.

"This clown Bishop McElroy along with quite a few others apparently, just doesn't get it:  A Muslim's primary purpose in life to to exterminate Christians, or anyone else who doesn't think like them.  Sweden is now the rape capitol of Europe and second in the world in rapes per capita, all thanks to the Muslim invaders.  They don't think like we do.  They do not share our values.  They have no respect for women, the environment, animals, or human life.  McElroy is naive and a fool.  Hopefully Darwins principle removes him from the picture because what he preaches is cultural and religious suicide.  A war is coming over the fate of the earth - Islam or Christianity.  We all need to pick which side we want to be on and quit consorting with the enemy."
"And they can be taken to task for it as Republican President Ford was when he pardoned Nixon.  Of course at that time voters were more ethical, moral and sane, recognized corruption, and so vote lost his re-election bid. Now we have Trump's base, a constituency that doesn't know what those words mean and could care less that Trump is at best a corrupt loser and at worse a traitor."

"Wrong... what is malignant is the media.  What the media is doing is taking sides against half the country who believe what Trump is doing is the right thing and it is bias schmucks like you in the media that are part of the problem not part of the cure.  

In fact for decades now you have declared war against the average working man/woman because you think YOU are enlightened and that the citizenry are too stupid to manage their our own lives... that YOU and big brother govt knows best.   

So thanks but no thanks asking for our help in destroying Trump... we plan on destroying the scum in the media instead."
"He's dangerous, not because he's an idiot but because he doesn't have the best interests of the US at heart but his own self interest. He's also dangerous, because some of his supporters are armed, dangerous and willing to start a violent revolt if they don't win."

"What a load of crap! It astounds me that someone of this author's stature would go by the word of people who write for the NYT, that is known for peddling Putin bashing fake news. If Putin was such a tyrant and a strong arm dictator why would his ratings be the highest of ANY statesman currently AND is widely popular with his fellow compatriots?
Also, the Crimea wasn't ""annexed"" but was legally taken back through an internatinally recognised referendum where 95% of the population voted to be incorporated back into the Russian Federatoon. If this author had done her research properly she would have known this and  discovered other real facts of the Russian Leader.  She selectively picks negative moments about Putin from the Oliver Stone interviews for the purposes of this article to fit her story in comparison to JZ the idiot. Had she done her homework properly she would also have learnt, thanks to Putin, that European and Asian countries are joining the SCO to improve trade relations."
"Betcha ten bucks that many of these victimized white men also scoffed at the #MeToo protest that is going on to highlight sexual harassment.

Well that's a comment straight out of a Trump Rally.  Even I saw that one on the news.  Try to think like a big boy and come up with an original comment so we don't have to keep calling you an idiot.
"Kasich should talk - he went around HIS statehouse and accepted the Medicaid expansion like an idiot.  Then had a hissy fit because Trump beat him.  He's like McCain and Graham, the alt-left media always go to him when they want ""... and Republicans agree with the left's lies..."" quotes."

Trump is a bold-faced liar and a pure-bred racist. He is no better than a bonafide member of the Ku Klux Klan. He is probably a full-fledged mebmer of the White Nationalists. Trump is a disgrace and an enemy of America. He needs to be impeached.

Walmart pays its average employee close to minimum wage.  As a result, the beneficiaries of Walmart's recent Thanksgiving charity drive to feed the hungry included its own employees.  Maintaining the current minimum wage means that homelessness will increase, as there are homeless families whose adult members are working, but are not making enough to pay rent. On the other hand, Costco has proven that it's possible for big box stores to pay much more, as it pays its average employee $20 an hour.  That should be the minimum expectation for all workers in the most prosperous country on earth."

Even while Obama investigated and illegally surveilled some media members the bulk of these creeps still supported his criminal activities and utilization of government agencies to batter his political opponents.

He and his crew were the  worst criminals ever to occupy the W.H.  History will not be kind to Obama when the research and exposures are written.  He took advice from a known slumlord and crooked operator.

What jokes the republicans  have become.  

I realize the Donald will never show us his tax returns as then he will be shown to be the fraud he is.  But since he complained about Obama's birth certificate, I can complain about his tax returns.  I could be demanding to see his birth certificate to prove his father was not an Orangutan"

Dotard said that ""healthcare would be easy"" (how's that ""repeal & replace"" coming along?), Dotard also said reining in the N Korean's would be easy also but after meeting with Xi Jinping said “After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it’s not so easy,”. Dotard also said that building the wall that Mexico would pay for was going to be easy. How's that wall coming along? Then just today he said ""he would not rest until Puerto Rican's are safe"" as he boarded Air Force One for yet another taxpayer paid for golf trip (24th or 25th golf trip?) to his club in New Jersey.

"""I have no idea what to say in rational response to such an extreme (and I might add, insulting to at least half the nation) take on the election success of the president elect.""

Really, utilitas?   Trump didn't get the support of over half the nation.  He finished second in the popular vote, and over 100 million voters didn't vote out of either indifference or Republican voter suppression.  Considering that the president-elect is a lying, misogynist, racist ignoramus who is including neo-Nazis in his inner circle, perhaps those voters who voted for him deserve to be insulted."

He was not just a ""N#$%$#"", he was a ""N$#%$"" who wasn't even born in America.""  

We now have a GOP Presidential candidate who openly parades his racism and xenophobia..and his followers love it.  

I ask myself, ""can we really elect such a man to be our President?""  Is the hatred and bogotry Mr. Trump's actions and comments have disclosed really OK with a majority of American voters?
Do those who approve and support such a view really represent today's America?

"WHY does it have to go to ala moana ?  This state is insane, they would not lose ridership, only current bus riders will be on the stupid thing anyway."
I thought that Bannon was scary but it turns out he is a moron.  The bishops should send him a fruit basket for making them look good.  It is the first time in ages that they have gotten good publicity from the press and lots of kudos from the public.
"In order to be funny you need a fool to ridicule.
No matter how much you hated Obama and his politics he didn't run around hiring fools and saying moronic crap like Trump and Bush..."

Two lives wasted for the most idiotic reason possible.
"motley:  There is NO question HE is an OLD FOOL, and OLD Druggie.    In his mind, HE is supplying a 25 year old woman with METH, and getting that young woman Bang Job, just what ALL of us OLD guys fantasize about, right????   Both these people need Drug Intervention and Mental Illness Intervention."
"LOL, Captain Crayons,, hilarious! Will this moron from the land of unicorns and rainbows ever stop earning uncomplimentary nicknames"
"Right. A racist, sexist, bigoted, adulterous liar of a president should be supported, and those who voted for him praised.

Previous conservative presidents at least gave lip service to their Christianity. Do you really see Trump doing even that?"
"educated adults should just laugh and feel sorry for the pathetic brain washed ignorant sheep like you , you are as close we come to a clown these days!,,"
"Does this nutcase not realize how many people died on 9/11? Does she really think her losing the Pres election equates to that many lives being lost? Rather than blame Russia, Comey, Bernie, etc., why doesn't she just ask those of us who voted for Obama but not her why we didn't vote for her. She will hear about a lack of accomplishment, bad decisions, the Clinton Foundation, the arrogance, the corruption. She will hear many of us made our minds up the day she forced herself, I mean announced her candidacy. She ran a horrible campaign. We saw it. We lived through it. She makes herself look foolish when she offers these lame untrue excuses."
"Idiot isn't it, ben w?"
that goal is pure alt left stupidity brain washing bs
"Assuming the ""everyday Americans"" being referred to are these same idiots and racists that support Trump, I'd say Hillary is definitely not alone in hating such people. Anyone with a minimum of intelligence and personal dignity is offended by these cretins who make all Americans look backward and mentally deficient. 
It really depends on how you define ""everyday Americans"" and if you look at Hillary's platform, that is, the policies she has stated on record that she intends to pursue when she becomes president, I say, I don't care who someone said they think Hillary hates as long as she actually tries to implement the non-rich people-friendly policies she has crafted in her policy statements. 
Seriously, what's the option--voting for Republicans? These people are always saying how much they love average Americans while they stab them in the back supporting policies that favor only the rich. The policies favored by Republicans are a matter of public record."
"At least you and the Nazis have the same ideas. Congratulations, you are human scum."
"I read every comment about all of you on multiple websites, you have to be stupid to think people don't."
"This donation won't help a bit with tuition, so you are right. But the scale of the problem is a little daunting. UO has 25,000 students, so if this donation were to be used to help reduce tuition, it would drop tuition by $280 per student for one term this year and then be gone. That's a tough sell to a donor. It could also be made into an endowment to help reduce tuition forever... by $3.50 a term per student!"
"only the ignorant left thing trump is a disaster when its the congress so far, trump is doing pretty good over all getting much done"
How did all these people have such stupid attorneys. That's who they should sue. There is no science behind the claim to begin with.
Bobby Hammons you unbelievable scumbag. If anyone has drug money they are protecting that's Jeffrey Keebler Elf Leprechaun Sessions. He is a puppet of Big Pharma and Tobacco.

Carl Bernstein is known as a malicious left-wing schmuck.
"Yeah.  Terrible few days for the Democrats (again).  

First there was the Inauguration of a narcissist, racist, misogynist.  Then the eventual, but quick reveals (on almost a daily basis) that he's also unable to do the ""deals"" he promised, not only a racist but a White Supremacist (the worst kind of racist), ripping off the Federal Government allowing his subordinates to do so, an idiot who doesn't understand what he's talking about, an international provocateur who appears to WANT nuclear war, etc., etc., etc.

THEN, this.  One of the guys who was supposed to give us confidence that the bundle of severe deficiencies and disorders occupying the seat of President would be balanced by someone of cooler temperament, intelligence and unquestionable character.

The horror.  Kelly is either a liar or incompetent.  

Now, I'm really scared.  

And, I wonder what the military has done in the past that Kelly has either lied about or covered up. . . ."
"The left calls for Trump to be assassinated, to blow up the White House, say that Trump is Hitlerian, a racist, sexist, homophobic, idiotic con man. 
Trump says Crazy Bernie, Crooked Hillary, Low IQ Mika, Psycho Joe, Low energy Jeb, Elizabeth Pocohantas, Lyin Ted.
He insults and they insult. There is no indication in the above insults that he treats women any differently."
"well patuk , guess what, your hero hillbilly will soon be under inditement. meanwhile, trump is trying to clean up the country of ner do wells. with a name like patuk, i suspect you are one of the jerks he will kick out soon."
"The funniest part of all this is that it only confirms just how stupid Kaneshiro is -- that he didn't see this POS story he told -- meant to help cover up for Katherine Kealoha -- coming back on him at some point in the future.

"Your show of racism proves the cliche about when fool open their mouthes.
Eight years, hahahahaha the man with the yellow possum oh his head won't last 2 years."
"But that gives ""clueless moron"" a bad reputation. Charlie is far worse; he's crooked (and proud of it)."
"Sure. I guess Trump forced this fool to act like a criminal. He looks like a homeless guy that needs a job. If it was my kid, regardless of political position, I would give him a crack upside his head. I guess I'm just a big old square."
"What a stupid, useless graphic.  Which neighbourhoods are which?"
Play stupid games and win Hollow point prizes .
Hopefully the republican establishment can keep Trump and Bannon in check and the sooner the better. Clearly things have to change and change fast before this buffoon gets us into a world war or causes another depression.

"I noticed that Brad Trost’s wife Gerelt, who is from Mongolia, wrote a letter to the Globe, protesting her husband being called a racist by Knox. He obviously doesn’t have anything against Asians. 
Bill Clinton was the only president of the US whose penis was described in court proceedings while he was in office,  possibly the only leader of any country. Really hard to fathom why Knox would have wanted to give this vicious, sexual predator and his rebarbative slut-shaming wife a third term in the White House. Thank God she and her accomplices didn’t succeed."
"Mr. Trump is a psychotic.  He cannot be removed from office soon enough.

He is a disgrace to the United States."

Hilarious.......stupid but hilarious!!!!
You wish trumps a fool.
"Hey dummy, he isn't Scottie."
Very apropos of CNN's typical coverage of the news.
"Sure Lazee. Continue to rationalize your support of an idiotic demagogue with paper-thin excuses about ""dumping a lifelong politician"". Intelligent observers saw the differences between Clinton and Trump quite clearly with Clinton being a competent establishment candidate with clearly defined policy initiatives, and Trump being a thin-skinned megalomaniac in far over his head with aggressively bad policy proposals, where he bothered to come up with any, that is. Of course, no one has accused you of being an intelligent observer, have they?"
"Trump has been around this long only because he’s a white guy with tons of white privilege. He should have been gone a long time ago, especially after screaming “tell ‘em to go f**k themselves” at a campaign and bragging about being able to grab women by their pu**y because he’s rich and famous."
"This man sounds insane, totally lost it, classic case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. What could he possibly be thinking of to make such outrageous and ridiculous claims about the president? Does he have no clue as to how he looks and sounds when he is saying such patently false things? Does he think the American people are so stupid as to believe anything he is saying? Buy a vowel, a majority of Americans were not impressed and didn't support his efforts against President Nixon. Hounding a legitimately elected president out of office is nothing to be proud of, Carl Bernstein has not improved with age. He is still the same arrogant a-hole he has always been in the past."
"There was no chemical weapons attack ""by"" Damascus, you dirty old liar."
"Whites never learn....you're making enemies with the world - Blacks (lives matter/cops killing innocent blacks), Browns (destroying entire region and creating chaos), Slav Russians (yeah, anglos dont really consider them part of their own, so...), Yellow (sending the navy as potential ""PREEMPTIVE"" strike; not allow China to take uninhabited atols, when white STOLE and KILLED other of their land).
Whites should enslave all blacks in America or send them back to Africa (on the way throw them oveboard), Nuke the crap out of Middel East and keep their Oil. Nuke the Crap out of Yellow peril so you can not only have the Pacific Ocean as your backyard, you can have the Yellowman's backyard as well!"
"Hopefully, whoever was running this ""ed-venture"" chastised the idiot for harassing the goat.  Another example of human stupidity in the face of pure grace and beauty."

From the same fools who would have us double military expenditures while denying climate change.  Typical.
These rating probably aren't even right. Cry babies just want to try make it seem like they are making a difference. None of the players are kneeling to disrespect the flag or america. Do any of you idiots out there that want the nfl banned. Think about all the players who all ways stand and the players who have served before. The ones that help their communities and other charities. Want the nfl banned for the few players kneeling. When is probably less than 1% of the nfl kneeling. But you idiots think justice is nfl getting banned and all the players being out the job. Just seem so selfish and greedy that some people want that. Fuck all the players that stand that have served and that help out alot. They should all be out the job for the few the many shall pay. But of course greed is the american way.

"Cory Gardner has some work to do, however he is 100% right on this. I can't understand why anyone would have a problem with this statement unless they subscribe to the same beliefs as the domestic terrorists who have the blood of Heather Heyer on their hands.

I give to select charities now : Salvation Army, St. Vincents,  Red Cross.
Consider that most donors with money to give are paying more taxes, I think some charities are not surprisingly in trouble."

Why is he the worst attending PM in the House of Commons in recent history? Because he can't speak off the top of his head in Question Period and struggles without rehearsed lines so the Liberals purposefully find reasons for him to leave Canada."

"Chris, my intent was  to back up that line with the explanation of the Supreme Court rulings later in the column, which effectively limit campaign finance laws to stopping quid pro quo corruption, which many interpret as an explicit exchange of a donation for a particular vote. By defining corruption so narrowly, the court said it is almost impossible, and by saying the public has a right to regulate campaigns only to fit that narrow definition, it said that very little concern about public integrity is justified."
"Wow.....the Bush peoples are fake?  Darn......I wanted to leave from Maine and go to Alaska so I could rub dirt on myself and climb trees, and get a deal on a 5 K WWII mine sweeper for delivering a crappy front end of a 1935 buick made into a desk.  Everyone knows that these things are not in the lower 48.   I have now changed my mind and want to homestead in VA so I can just crap wherever I feel like, with the pigs, and have some dude with a cowboy hat wearing a dress shirt tell me how and where to crap in an outhouse I really don't need (being a stupid city slicker...arf arf)."

No actually. They will sit down like any other woman. Stop being ignorant
"Vintage Trump SOP.  Make an idiotic, provocative statement (or present an idiotic, provocative tax 'plan' in this case) and watch the talking heads go berserk bashing, defending, and debating it.  Meanwhile, all eyes are turned away from his incredibly inept performance and collusion with Russia.  
When will the media ever learn?  Answer: Never.  Thus it is incumbent upon all of us to discriminate between real issues and Trump alt-issues."
Trmplethinskin is a narcissistic sociopath with visions of dictatorship dancing though his orange locks.
"Trump is just playing to his base. You know the deal.  Black celebrities can and admirably do bring racism to the public focus. Trump is playing to the bigoted idiots that liked his 7 years of ""birther"" horse excrement. He gets em all fired up over nothing, pretends he is all presidential, tweets his brains out. Next day its some other trivial attention seeking headline. Tired of winning already!"
"I don't know.  Folks in Nevada are pretty stupid and ignorant, from what I have experienced with them.  Their school system has been a wreck for decades, just like Oregon's.   Plus they have a very transient population, with a lot of Casino workers.    Much of the population is very low class.    Tobacco, alcohol, and drug use are all very high.  Jurors should be far less sophisticated and intelligent, compared to a jury from Portland.

Let's hope that the Federal Prosecutors in Las Vegas do indeed do a better job."

"Ok, you say Fox news and Breitbat don't tell the truth. So,I went back and watch Trumps press conference. Here were is exact words: The KKK, white supremacist and the Neo nazis are repungnant and violence has no place in this country. Yet, the left and the braindead media, CNN, ABC MSNBC, all lied and said Trump likes the KKK. So, there you go, just caught you and every news media except Fox lying thru your teeth like only scumbags can do."
"Your 6-3 decision came from the MSM sloptrough. Try pulling your head out and take the time to look it up. You ""losers"" can learn something. October the SCOTUS will hear arguments. The vote was a 9-0 slap in the face for you clowns. So get over it."

"There are many who idiotically point to Bill Clinton. 
First, do not try to excuse Trump’s bad behavior with Clinton’s behavior, that is what children do.

I was not a fan of Bill Clinton and I am not a democrat. Bill Clinton received deferments just like Trump did.
Bill Clinton was eligible for the draft in 1969. Trump was never eligible.

Trump is a draft dodging coward. 
Clinton was a draft eligible weasel.

The only people you are hurting with your stupid boycott are the people who work at the NETWORKS, the NFL will be just fine. Read it and weep , MORONS. 

Until the broadcast contract ended in 2013, the terrestrial television networks CBS ($3.73B), NBC ($3.6B) and Fox ($4.27B) — as well as cable television's ESPN ($8.8B) — paid a combined total of US$20.4 billion to broadcast NFL games.

I`m retired and I`ll pay my fair share of income taxes, like good citizens do in other states to keep infrastructure, schools and maintenance and public services up to snuff.  If my state and it`s citizens don`t want a proud university and k-12 education system, with 70 billion dollars available to ""draw on"" to help keep taxes low STILL, while maintaining the quality of education we all hope for,,.. then we are letting our own society and it`s binding fabric down. (even reinstating a state income tax would make us the second lowest income or sales- taxing state in the union..)."

"The Republican Party is tripping over themselves trying to distance themselves from the Alt Right. It's all lip service. The Aryan Nation Party (GOP) pitched a hissy fit when the Obama administration tried to put white supremacist groups on the terrorists watch list. It is the their white trash president that for more than eight years demanded to see President Obama's birth certificate. It was their white trash congress that obstructed at every turn, even denying President Obama's Supreme Court nominee for nearly a year. It was because he was the first Black President. No the Republican / Aryan Nation Party owns this. No amount of lip service will suffice. It is time to call out the entire party.

Uh? Harper delivered 6 straight deficits including a record $56 billion in 2009-10. He lowered the HST lowered taxes and wiped out in no time flat a huge surplus he inherited from the Liberals.

And have you noticed that the monthly Federal deficits have gradually been creeping up.  now they're at 3.3 billion for a single month. If you have the slightest idea how a federal government constructs its finances you would grasp that it is the trend that kills.  Your pal Trudeau campaigned on the basis of 10 billion dollar deficits for a few years... The finance department itself has said we will see deficit till 2050. Canadian banks are forecasting deficits 35 to 40 billion dollars and we're now well on the way to achieving them.

Now, could you tell us where exactly is all that infrastructure that Trudeau promised? Projects aren't even on the drawing board and he's already spewing cash off the back of the truck. Liberal  bag of fools"

No, the govt. did not have the power per Article 1, Section 8 to use that tax $$$ for O-Care.  Again, even if it did, it would be wrong for it to do so.

Immigration can only maintain the confidence of the populace if you properly extreme vet and only allow in people who make the country better.   The absolute test must be ""does this persons presence make Canada (or other jurisdiction) a better place than it is without them""?

Unfortunately the answer is often a no ... and we let them in anyways ... and then act surprised when they slaughter our citizenry or abuse our social safety nets or spread their religious hatred to others.  

Foolish but predictable ....  liberals and democrats open your eyes please."

They're thinking that all they have to do is press some of the answers and they can leave."

What we as a voting public need to keep in mind through these statements or mea culpa's, or whatever they're supposed to be, is that the ""press"", and the media in general is still owned by a mere handful of people, and that handful is primarily interested in keeping the money coming in, in that giant bonanza we refer to as an election ""year.""  They might not even be here in this age of the internet if not for the huge amounts campaign cash that have come to define election cycles, and politics in general."

Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.

In many cases, it is now often possible to make and defend quantitative statements about the extent to which human-induced climate change (or another causal factor, such as a specific mode of natural variability) has influenced either the magnitude or the probability of occurrence of specific types of events or event classes."""

Stop being ignorant and lazy and try reading a bit about it.
The university could have attempted such a ban if they wanted to have one (though it would have failed in any legal test it faced).  The city touted using the money for all sorts of 'good health and wellness programs' for its residents including several areas right near the university.  Unsurprisingly the city also targeted the area around the University in its efforts to get the tax approved.   Basically the sales job amounted to you will get all these things and someone else will pay for them.  Now it turns out that those students that were so stoked to get all that free stuff that someone else would pay for... will be paying for all that free stuff elsewhere in the city.  The university makes up 25% of the total tax to be collected.  So rather than being the recipients of 'other peoples money' they are instead the 'other people' paying for all the projects elsewhere in the city.

"The increasing use of online education means that some of the smaller campuses are no longer needed. These campuses typically have very limited course choice, and thus stream students into programs that they may not want or the community may not need. Where programs need hands-on experience (auto mechanics, for instance) students will have to leave communities that can't support reasonable enrollment. That might require student aid to provide grants rather than loans to students in remote communities. It is still likely that there will be net savings and improved education quality."

"The author's assumptions about spending by retired baby boomers are off-base. Just because they know how to spend money doesn't mean they will continue to do so once retired. When retirees in their 60s (like me) are faced with fixed costs like property taxes and condominium fees  that are rising faster than their pension incomes do, naturally they will tend to reduce variable expenses wherever they can. Many others are falling back mainly on their savings (RRSPs and other) to fund their retirements, are searching desperately for better investment yields and don't have indexed pensions apart from CPP and OAS. Carrick should speak with some financial advisers who actually deal with retirees in their 60s - he might learn something from them."

Louise d'Epinay  hosted an enlightened salon and was partner of Melchoir Grimm. She offered  J.J Rousseau a cottage on her estate as his home. Most of all she wrote numerous books and wrote many famous letters to the Abbe Galiani expressing many of the values we now identify and aspire to.

"Trump is a Machiavellian type, which means that there is probably some dark purpose behind even his dumbest moves. This so called clown did defeat the best strategy the Dems had to offer, and they're pretty tricky their own selves. He also conned almost half of America to vote for him. Is it possible that Trump isn't as stupid as his opponents would want to believe?

Trump's latest actions could possibly lure Russia's interests to the west; so that in case of a war between America and China, Russia will be too far out of position, and preoccupied enough, so that Russia won't side with China?

Listen to the bulk of rhetoric ... almost all directed at N. Korea being an existential threat to America.

Our government is clearing the field for battle, and their first move is to pull Russia away from China.

We have the capability to pull a ""First-Strike"" against China, but not Russia and China simultaneously. Plus, without Russia's backing, China will probably wuss out."

"Word limitations for the opinion piece did not allow me to provide all of the information required to prove the points I was trying to make. There is no objective study done anywhere in Canada, at any time, that has shown that fees for dental work in AB is 50% higher than somewhere else, for the exact same treatment, codes, etc. The experience of one person (or 10) is not statistically valid.
Expenses in a dental practice are simple? No more simple than other small businesses...and in todays regulatory environment (radiation, infection control, security, privacy, and more) that is more onerous in AB than other provinces adds greatly to our expenses.
Bottom line...a fee guide will not solve that problem."

Why lay off Alaska's oil workers when they are drilling for the next 40 years of free Permanent fund money for you!

Why not enjoy more Permanent Fund money and let the oil workers of Alaska produce another 19 Billion barrels and 8 Trillion Cubic Feet of Gas and allow these incentives and earned credits keep finding new oil!

"One thing that I don't see in any press on this subject is the impact of a big minimum wage hike on the cost of child care.  Lots of child care workers earn a lot less than $13/hour.  I think all child care workers are undervalued and should earn far more than they do, but I don't know many families who can afford to pay significantly more for child care. Infant care in a center costs around $1200 a month now.  A big wage hike would push that cost up by hundreds of dollars a month, as the biggest expense most child care centers have is wages.  I think we'll see a lot of mothers pushed out of the labor force by the jump in child care costs.  Combine the loss of an income with generally higher costs for goods and services, and this minimum wage hike will hit middle class families hard.   I have yet to see Kotek or anyone else explain how families are going to manage the increased cost of child care, and I haven't seen anyone in the press ask them to."

"Cut any pipes sticking up down another foot to ground level so they are not a hazard and take care of the other issues which seem minor, but should be taken care of.  It's unfortunate this mine on lands the feds gave to the state for development was stopped from going through the permit process by one EPA employee with a personal environmental agenda, Phil North.  (Unlike Hillary, Phil was smart enough after corrupting the permit process and destroying his emails to flee the United States before he could be charged with multiple felonies for destroying official federal records) Not sure if the mine would have made it through the permitting process but if it did, the $1 billion a year in royalties and taxes to the State would have preserved the full permanent fund dividend payment for all Alaskans and sent another $400 million to the treasury for medicaid, education, and payments to seniors.

I think the Greens are reading too much into this win.  Many people like me voted Green because of the extreme corporate bias of the Liberals and on the other hand the undue influence of big labour on the NDP.  Anyone not aligned with these camps goes unrepresented. Andrew Weaver promised he would look at each situation and use an evidence based approach in making decisions.  That should have translated into taking the most rational and progressive portions of any issue. Unfortunately after the election the big lobby groups in the environment and labour pulled out all the stops and we instead have an NDP/Green alliance.   The pundits are underestimating the numbers who voted for the Greens out of protest of the other parties and the promise to shine a light on the business of government.

The tax return of the first member of the Romney family to run for president were the first ones released during a campaign. It was a publicity stunt that saw little scrutiny by voters or the press. Today a candidates tax return is a blood sport. In reality have any of these tax returns ever actually undergo a conclusive investigation proving they are the full and complete final filings.  NO.

I've seen enough bogus tax returns to know it is not complicated to produce one with whatever you want it to say.  The IRS does not care what you put out to the public.

My assumption is there is some number you are looking for that will swing your vote one way or the other.

Maybe this thought can help.  It isn't how many total companies but how many WILL pass the tax on to the poor thru lower middle class.  The poor won't or can't buy I-pads (optional for the more well to do.) and things like that  But the poor have to buy gas, food, and insurance.  They also have to pay utility bills.  I'm sure PacifiCorp (electricity), Portland General Electric, NW Natural Gas, CenturyLink, and all cell phone providers, et al. will easily pass the minimum threshold for the tax to kick in.  My guess is most public utilities like EWEB and SUB will also hit the minimum threshold.  These companies will all easily pass the tax on.  Does this help?"

Trump's quote on using nuclear weapons.

“I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process. It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen, because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.”

"What are the charges?  A crime on U.S. soil? or does the U.S. continuing to act as police agency for the world paid by the U.S. taxpayers?  The same idiocy resulted in the Iraq invasion while Saudi Arabia, the home and source of funding for the 9/11 terrorists, escaped any penalty.  The worldwide unleashing of the CIA and the entire Security Apparatus to fund and fill foreign prisons with individuals kidnapped from their homelands without any legal justification other than ""we can"".  The illegal, corrupt, anti-human terrorist policies devoid of any intelligence and/or common sense driven by military might without concern for human rights.  Time for a Revolution."
"I live in the GVRD and have followed this very closely, even though I don't live near the pipeline or facilities. 
First I'll say I'm not opposed to the pipeline, but I am opposed to it's location right through the middle of the GVRD.  The current route puts many people in great danger, even though KM have altered over 50% of the route to improve it. When it was initially built over 60 years ago, that region wasn't very populated  and there was only the occasional oil tanker travelling through the harbour.
 My suggestion is why doesn't the pipeline stay on the south side of the Fraser River, then go on the flat delta land to the Roberts Bank docks?  I was very pleased when I was told by a KM person at an open house, they also felt that route was best, but they said it would be much more difficult than just expanding the current route. Even the premier of AB suggested that route a few years ago.
 So the pipeline will go in the wrong location because it is an easier procedure !

"SCOTUS deep-sixed your analysis of the  predicate clause regarding the ""necessity of a well-regulated militia"" back in 2008.

The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. ~ District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008)
https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZS.html

And that ratio was extended nation-wide two years later in  in McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. 742 (2010) which was brought in response to Heller and decided in 2010, that invalidated much of Chicago's gun purchase and registration laws."

"I'll take  shot. CDF has a long and checkered history, but at least since the appointment of then-Cardinal Ratzinger (1981), has become less pastoral and more juridical-canonical. Pope Francis inherited as Prefect Cardinal Mueller, who has a pastoral side, but leans heavily toward the juridical-canonical work of the Congregation. By appointing Cardinal O'Malley, Pope Francis adds a pastoral voice that echoes throughout many parts of the Catholic world. In this sense, he appears to be sending a signal that he wants CDF to be more pastoral and that, if necessary, he will replace Mueller.
Some commentators in Rome believe O'Malley is Francis' choice to succeed him, in which case a position in CDF would help make his case in a future conclave."

"WOW! All one has to do to find this letter factual and agree with it is to completely ignore history .Take your misguided thinking on Reagan for example..we know for sure that we experience no gain in long-term tax revenue from increasing tax rates on those making more than $200,000 per year. Lower tax rates, particularly on labor and capital, lead to higher levels of employment and economic growth. 

The Reagan tax cuts reduced rates for all income classes, especially the low and middle income earner. Reducing the high marginal rates (up to 70% on high-income earners) causes little, if any, revenue loss, because of the large, positive supply-side effects.  by the time President Reagan left office, the economy was generating more tax revenue at a maximum 28% rate than many on the left forecast it to generate at a maximum 70% rate.
The Reagan tax-rate reductions did, in fact, pay for themselves — but it took about seven years."

"I read your link.  As a mental health practitioner I think the article you cite fails to mention that in teenagers, the executive centers of the brain are not fully functional and won't be until the mid twenties.  The military seems to understand this on some intuitive level because they take teenagers and put them in infantry and other front line killing situations.  We can see this historically for millennia and recently with even younger children in the developing world.  We really need to understand that teenage brains are not yet adult brains and decisions we think teens should be capable of making aren't a given.  

I will most certainly watch this series to make up my own mind, but the fact it's been produced is a positive thing....whether that makes us comfortable or not."
"The environmentalists have outlawed HFCs....HFCs are 1% of our emissions , one unit of HFT emission is equal to up to 14,000 units of CO2 emission per Environment Canada. The average  HFT unit is 1,000 times as damaging as one unit of CO2 equivalent. CO2 equals 78% of our GHG emissions. So, one unit of HFT times 1,000 versus 78 units times 1. Elimination of HFTs eliminates 95% of the GHG problem re global warming. That is the point that Kerry was making. To drive my point even further, the model that predicted doom and gloom assumed global HFT emissions increasing from 1% to 19% by 2050. Shake up all your brain cells and join the dots. Neither US EPA or Environment Canada are disputing the above."

"There is an old story of a rabbi who was called in times of crisis. He would go to the town, light a candle, tell a story, and say a prayer. And the crisis would pass.

In time, the rabbi got old. The people now had to carry him to the town, where he would light a candle, tell a story, and say a prayer. And the crisis would pass.

After many years, the rabbi was too poor to light a candle and too forgetful to say the prayer. So he told the story and prepared to die. And the crisis passed.

The traditional moral of the tale is that the Lord loves a good story. The second moral of the tale is: none of us really knows if one of these days the Lord will use a very imperfect instrument to save us."

Wrong, dumb, clueless, regrettable, destructive, and stupid all describe certain events in my own teenage years too. I'm glad nobody wanted to shoot me for it."

when the liberal govt took office two years ago the first thing they did was fill the vacant senate seats. 3 to western canada and 21 to the east. one of the results was that bc and alberta have 12 seats and quebec has 24. this is in spite of bc and alberta population is larger than quebecs. now down stream green house gas imissons apply to domestic produced oil but not to imported oil. there other issues to but the bottom line is that we have a regional govt not a national govt. this must be addressed.

Actually, there appears to be much, much more to Their Finest Hour than the Dunkirk sequences. ""Based on a story in the news...""  Really?  Thought it was based on a novel.

The articles are about poor NSA document retention, security, and handling rules and practices which could breach privacy rights, and the concern of the ACLU the danger of unmasked names being circulated. These issues predate still exist today as a general matter. But the specific issues with unmasking of Trump communications picked up when non-citizens were being monitored is not covered except to say we should be sure those names were protected. In an interview on March 19, Nunez said the documents leaked by the two Whitehouse employees at the National Security Counsel and any other information Nunez saw did not contain any evidence of illegal unmasking or any FISA warrants for Trump. He did say he wanted Congress to take a look at the procedures involving unmasking to be sure they are as protective of privacy as they should be."

You can buy a fully-automatic AK platform weapon in the ME, Africa, and much of South Asia and South America for a hundred bucks or less.  Brand name handguns are hard to get, but there are lots of serviceable copies out there.   There is relatively little flow of legally purchased weapons to criminals.   Most guns in the hands of criminals were illegally purchased by straw men, stolen, or smuggled.   Of course, not a few were put in the hands of criminals by the Obama Administration in their unbelievably stupid ""Fast and Furious"" gun-running operation.   No legitimate bad guy would be caught dead with a US legal semi-automatic weapon.   A US legal AK starts at about $800 and is semi-auto, the smuggled one is cheaper and is full-auto; crooks are generally stupid, but not that stupid."

"Glad you brought this up Curtis:  a hidden subtext to most efforts to raise minimum wage rates is the fact that many union CBAs have negotiated wage rates that are tied to the minimum wage rate.   The union scale wage rates automatically adjust up in line with a formula set forth in the CBA whenever there is an increase in the minimum wage rate, and the union workers do not have to wait for the end of the CBA to renegotiate a wage increase in order to keep pace.
So, if you increase the minimum wage to $22 an hour over 4-5 years, you will be creating automatic pay increases in similar amounts on most union workers.  So, the economic impact on business is not limited to just those businesses who employ minimum wage workers.

Unions know this, and that's why they support politicians who push hikes in the minimum wage."

"Numerous factors. The fatigue regulations in Canada are decades behind other developed nations.

At that time (and probably still today), Air Canada pilots flew from Toronto to  San Jose, Costa Rica and back in a single day, with only 2 pilots, the same thing U.S. carriers couldn't do from Houston.

"Having worked in factories for probably 20 years before I managed to get into the software industry, I can say that I have seen behavior like Plainthinker describes.

They always tell the boss, it is for medical expenses, car repairs, or just rent, but sitting around the break room, they joke about how they pulled one over on the boss.

If you build walls then you also kill the air circulation, and would need to spend even more to keep the place cooler. Also, consider that you are fully comfortable in a box (walls) many of the people moving in have been living on the street a while and some are seriously not comfortable being enclosed in a box. Same, when next step first opened up, we had residents move in and then could not sleep in their cubicles, and instead slept in the parking lot next to the doors for a while, or slept in the larger more open common spaces of the shelter.

He's the guy who designed (and envisioned, to be frank) the kind of interfaces for which Apple is best known.   Without him, I'm not sure Apple would still be a standalone company.   To his credit, Jobs recognized the talent that Ive has, supported it, and didn't mess with it.

"Fair question.  Students, in the process of acquiring an education, learn skills and coping strategies.  Many students with challenges will ultimately develop strategies to work efficiently, albeit differently than the norm.  Their work is not ""less than"",  just produced differently.   Student support is also about facilitating strategies and developing self-advocacy.  My point with the tech sector is that employers, by being open to unusual work practices, get the creative and excellent output they need, when they need it, though the process often looks very non-traditional, even chaotic.   

 I have no issue with the fact that certain work environments require specific skills.  Part of transitioning to the workforce is the fact that ALL students, regardless of ability, need to match their skill set with work.  My point is that by accommodating kids who learn differently we give them a better chance to develop skills that could prove valuable- we just need to step outside the box."

"Incidentally - after reading Zinke's article - I am even more concerned...

Unlike the scoffers below (Calling Balderas names like a grade-school bully isn't advancing your argument), I understand that there are children who come to school with deep issues that make learning extremely difficult. It'd be nice if all parents did a good job, but many of them don't, and we still want their kids to be productive members of society. We're stuffing them in loud, overcrowded classrooms, and it's not helping them or their peers, and it's burning out the teachers. 4J knows class size is of huge importance to parents, but they continue to blame schools and ignore parents.

Same deal with Trudeau and Trump.    But Trump has clearly not acted in his country's best interests.   In 8 months he has pandered to JUST his core  support and has reduced the U.S. President's stature to that of an international joke as well as increased divisions in his own country (and party).      Trudeau campaigned on the left but has governed more ""right"" which is how Liberals usually govern.   But arguably - that is what they SHOULD do, since they are governing for the entire country, not just their supporters.   No govt should pander to JUST their own supporters."

Some corners following a meandering tide line drawn by nature that make a mockery of the linear mythology of an exact 200 foot measurement.  The actual meander as authenticated by expensive tideland US recorded BLM surveys which it is illegal to obliterate.  So, ARRC owns to the point where the soil is tidally affected and gets wet.  You may have tidelands filled to the moon but they remain forever tidelands which were given to the people of the state of Alaska irrevocably in 1959 if one believes that.

Yet following the Civil War, Lee didn't continue the fight for slavery but accepted the new way of things. As southern Americans went, he was enlightened for his day.

The point is, regardless of the slavery issue, Robert E. Lee was a genuine American hero. He was highly regarded in both the north and the south. He didn't create the complex political and social issues of his day. But he did act bravely and reasonably during the worst upheaval in American history."

"Trump's policy of encouraging 'growth'?

Encouraging growth by holding rallies where he preens for his adoring pawns is not policy.

He hasn't actually created any policy.  He's made a lot of promises, and most of them have been proven to be lies.

No, chris, your cheerleading only indicates you have no clue what growth was attained in the last administration or what specific policies account for that growth.

Trump, though not actually creating any policy yet, has been dismantling and destroying policy enacted by President Obama and just like with the health care fiasco, Trump is going to create more disasters of the same or worse proportion.

What is huge is the likelihood of your cheerleading being all for naught.  

And the people most likely to bear the brunt of Trump's disasters are old folks like you and me.

The difference between me and you is you're cheering for your own demise.

I'm standing against the idiocy.

You see, stock market crashes are a normal part of investing, and some of us with long term mindsets know that in a year or two the stock market will be churning up again and most if not all the losses recouped.  Just because the market crashes people still have loans they are paying, they still have to heat and power their home, they still have cell phones and gas to put in their cars etc. etc. etc.  Life goes on, and so do profits at these great companies.

I use this example a lot but here goes again.  This fall the Bank of Montreal will celebrate their 200th year in business.  Yes, 1817 to now.  In 1829 they started making dividend payments, and have not missed one since.  188 years of consecutive dividend payments.  Through two world wars, and EVERY single crash you mentioned and more, they kept churning out cash to their shareholders.  Do you really think this will change?

The simple fact is that the world consists of stupid people, lazy people, uneducated people, ignorant people, smart people, motivated people, educated people, and knowledgeable people. People are all individuals.  As long as everyone is permitted to follow their own paths and protected by the same laws, government has done all it should.  It is called equality of opportunity not equality of outcome."

"Absolutely. The employee contribution as a percentage of earnings (up to the maximum) was 1.8% from 1966 until 1987 when it increased to 1.9%.  From 1988 to 2003 there was a steady increase in the rate up to 4.95%.  The increase was the direct result of dire warnings that CPP would be insolvent within 20 years if the program wasn't changed.

Your employer or the self-employed of course double that contribution for the respective period.  Which is a cost ultimately borne by the employee in foregone pay increases.

Current government policy is to increase the contributions by another full 1% within the next 8 years.  

So we have gone from a program that cost employees 3.6% to one that currently costs almost 10% increasing to 12% in the near term."

"""during September of 2016, a decision was made by the CRD to build a sewage treatment plant at McLoughlin Point to service the seven core municipalities of Victoria. Construction started April of this year, and the plant will be fully operational with tertiary treatment by 2020.  Although there were rumblings of community advocacy on this issue as early as the 60s, if we look at the organized campaign that started in 2004, it took 16 years to see this campaign through to the end and to finally stop the practice of discharging 150 million liters (or approx. 40 million gallons) of untreated sewage effluent daily into the coastal waters that surround Vancouver Island and make up the northern border of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State.""

"Andrey Pavlov - where to start?

1. ""Taxpayer liability"". How is this program a potential taxpayer liability if the homeowner defaults on their mortgage? In BC, defaults lead to foreclosure and sale of property. Owners are not entitled to any gains in that situation, which would go to the mortgage providers.

2.  ""The program adds more debt"". That is a falsehood, it merely advances in time the decisions of prospective purchasers to acquire a home. Does UBC School of Business not understand the time value of money? I.e. buy property now instead of next year when it has gone up more than 2.5% in value.

Also, what needs to be clarified is all of the different sources of oil revenue. I am by no means an expert, but the state is receiving revenue from production taxes, royalty oil (which they sell at a premium price, which makes the state as much money as possible, but also drives up the prices we pay at the pump), and corporate income taxes. Additionally, local governments collect property taxes. What really confuses matters is when the state further defines revenue as restricted or unrestricted.

Trump and his cronies are dirty.

You can smell it.

He and Vladimir Putin, the greatest thief in history, are a matched pair.

Well, except for the thirty-IQ-point advantage that Putin has over Trump.

Otherwise....twins separated at birth.

They must have come from the same gene pool, though Trump came from the shallow end of the pool.

"Health care is not a right...It’s a valuable service provided by intelligent, hard-working professionals with years of painstaking education and training, people who, like other Americans, deserve equal protection under the law, people who, like other Americans, have a right to their own life, liberty, property and the pursuit of their own happiness. 

Doctors, nurses, hospitals, drug-makers, and health insurers are no more “servants” of the masses, or even of those in need of health care, than are businessmen, bankers, teachers, journalists, or truck drivers servants of those who need their services. If you want to pay for the services of health care providers, then pay them; if you can’t afford it, try to negotiate a discount, or pay by installments, or seek access to private charity; but you have no “right” to take from health care providers what they’re not willing to supply."

I'm not saying that Lee's belief in slavery was right, but it was a different time.  We see it now through a very different lens - the lens of time.  You must realize how people thought at the time is different than now.  You cannot go back and demonize someone based on the morals of today's world.  What did he do after the war?

After Robert E. Lee surrendered, the general was pardoned by Lincoln. Lee moved to Lexington, Virginia, where he became the president of Washington College. It is believed that he accepted this low-profile post, which paid only $1,500 a year, because he felt it unseemly to profit after such a bloody and divisive conflict. In 1865, Lee signed an amnesty oath, asking once again to become a citizen of the US.  He did so as an active encouragement for confederate soldiers to rejoin the US.  Such a horrible, evil man."

Seeing that only1 in 11 students get into a Canadian Law school when they apply what happens to the ten? Well maybe 2 or 3 give up the rest go off shore. Bond University in Australia has a complete Canadian Law school and the other kids go to the United States or Britain - then they come back and the Canadian Federation of Law Societies lets them take catch up courses and bingo they write the Bar and are lawyers.

What would be interesting to me is to see what the average test score is for the PARENTS of our nation's children.  I'd bet we'd be close to last in the industrialized world.  Why?  All kinds of reasons: alternative ""facts,"" fake news, and a love-fest with a trillion dollar entertainment industry that makes us happy at the expense of a reasonable grasp on reality.  How many kids play video games when they have free time?  How many did that 50 years ago?  How many books does the average kid read now?  How about 50 years ago?  
I'm not saying we should go back to the 1960's, but rather the past times of the typical child have changed mightily in the last several decades.  As such the priorities of today's kids are much different than of those then.  Teachers face an incredibly daunting task in trying to educate children who have little interest in being educated - their idols are literally superheroes, not firemen, doctors, etc. who live in the real world."

Do we give up our home?

Do we not heat our home or eat food?

These are the questions that those of us who are middle class and not wealthy must ask ourselves when you demand that we pay for your ""free"" medical insurance.

You may believe that there's money out here in the working end of the economy that can go to provide your ""free"" medical insurance, but that money is NOT free. I earned it and I want and need to spend it on the things that matter to me.

If the situation were reversed, and I was the one expecting you to pay for my free-to-me medical insurance, you would feel exactly the same way I do now. What do we give up to support you?

In countries that have single-payer, most working people pay 40-60% of income in combined taxes & medical insurance coverage.They give up a lot."

You then say that the Court was right to ""requidiate"" the states' power to legislate on that subject, but you failed to say how the 14th Amendment led to or permitted ""requidiation.""  All you said was that the Court was right to do so.  

You also cited Section 5 of the 14th, which gives Congress the right to pass laws in furtherance of the 14th, but Roe had nothing to do with federal legislation."

What an attitude. Oh, there are conservatives coast to coast to coast as seen during the Harper era. Alberta is very diverse now - we have people from across Canada and the world. When you smear Alberta, your smear may be against people from your own home province who came to Alberta for ""work"" and live well.

It is time to look at unions in Canada. Do certified professions like teachers, nurses and other public service professionals need unionism? No. The government can set a sliding wage scale and increased pay should just not equate with how many hours/years on the job but the QUALITY of the work - just like in the private sector. Occupations that don't require specialized education need unions to protect worker rights.

- This is a good article.
- The USCCB's 'conscience rights' is its line in the sand -- ""come close to this and we walk.""
- Sadly, the USCCB has yet to learn that exercising ones conscience is done in pursuing the works of mercy. Using it as 'talking point' or line in the sand dishounours conscience.
- It is clear, that beginning with the presidency of ArchbFrancis, one time of Chicago, the USCCB sees itself as a interlocutor with power, and not as leaders of the local churches in the USA. That is, they will sell the poor for the sake of political gain.
- The proof of Christians is in what we do, not in what we protect. Take care of the sick poor first and then chat about conscience."

It's also fair to figure out how much each additional moose, caribou and deer cost the state and re-assess intensive management based on its costs and benefits."

In response, a federal agency sent an agent half way around the world pretending to be a broker who would sell the parts to the dude if he came to the US to pick them up.  The dude does not see an obvious problem with this at worst assuming that export restrictions are just minor infractions as most people think about such things.  He comes to the US and is arrested and will now face years in US jails.  Meanwhile, his family and employees suffer.  There is no evidence in the story to suggest that the dude would have acted in any way after being told by the manufacturer that he could not buy the parts.  Wisdom?"

St.Paul admonished us to examine ourselves -- not each other -- lest we eat and drink unworthily.  The church forms consciences by reflecting on Scripture, Tradition and the lived experience of the church, but goes beyond its biblical mandate when attempting to impose a ""one-size fits all"" discipline.  Whether an individual person or couple is in a ""sinful relationship"" is a judgment made between them, their confessor and their God.  Francis is simply -- finally -- calling us to spiritual adulthood.

"Trump wants private investors to basically direct $1 trillion in infrastructure projects nationwide through a “revenue neutral” financing plan, which banks on financing from private investors, allegedly to control deficit spending (which the GOP generally deems wasteful, while promoting tax breaks as a wiser redistribution of public funds into corporate coffers). To draw some $167 billion to jumpstart the $1 trillion, 10-year infrastructure plan, Washington would grant a giant tax break “equal to 82 percent of the equity amount.” The goal isn’t fixing bridges so much as fixing the corporate tax codes to promote privatization and unregulated construction with virtually no public input."

They paid the state a measly 10 million dollar dividend on nearly 500 million in cash.  

As far as home loan assistance for those who need it, that's not a bad idea. But they also loan to folks who qualify at private banks.  On the other hand private business can go to a private bank with their pro forma and ask for a loan, not a state government quasi entity. We cannot afford this anymore. I'm not sure what the Director's make, but it's probably a lot more than Walker as they are outside that wage control.

"""Canada has even co-opted the 'we are a nation of immigrants' thing."" Indeed. It looks like Trudeau got inspired by Angela Merkel's ""welcoming culture"" for migrants, imposed upon the Germans back in 2015. Chances are that many migrants, whether genuine refugees or those on the move for economic reasons, will feel highly encouraged to make their way to Canada fairly soon following Trudeau's warm words of encouragement: not good. It does appear as though many migrants from developing countries first travel to Latin America in order to proceed up to the US (where Trump has now made things a bit harder) and then to Canada. Those bland Canadian border guard shifts may soon be a thing of the past, they had better get ready for the impending stampede, and order plenty of flowers for the numerous welcoming ceremonies, Germany-style."

"Thank you, Sister, for your usual insightful column. I heard a Christian friend voted for Mr. Trump simply because ""I always vote Republican,"" without thinking about the issues. Another voted for Trump simply because of his dubious pro-life stance: dubious because he has been on both sides of the issue, and his attacks on women don't seem to me to be the attitude of a pro-lifer. What I find most incomprehensible about  Trump's support among evangelicals (80%) and white Catholics (60%), however,  is the free pass these Christians gave  him on his hateful comments. After thinking about those issues, I came to the conclusion that Jesus would not have voted for Mr. Trump.  But as Sister suggests, I think many  of Trump's Christian supporters did not think hard enough about their vote. I found it interesting that in the post-election days Hillary Clinton found it natural to quote Scripture; I cannot imagine Mr. Trump doing that."

I don't want to see anyone destroyed by false accusations. The accuser needs some kind of sanction imposed for making a false accusation. They shouldn't be able to accuse and then run off, as so many of the Trump accusers did do last year.  He stood his ground and no one got paid off as I've heard some liberals claim. I think it was the opposite, they were paid to pop up. There was such a bad smell to it. They all came out 'as if on cue' right after the Billy Bush tape.

Many others pointed it out as well but those comments have all been taken down.  Some of those commenters I'm sure knew Blake but I don't believe all of them did. Of course there is no way to say whether or not Dan does indeed know Blake on a personal level and if there is any discontent in that way but I would have to say that if it were at all true and Dan willingly used his journalistic power to attack Blake and his establishment then it is a truly unprofessional move and should be looked into by the Globe and Mail.

We go for walks with the dog, hiking, and go to the park.  It's not rocket science folks. It's just not.

We thought for sure, there was no way this was going to happen. Then, lo and behold, Jared was accepted.

"Moral equivalence between the US, a liberal democratic Republic, and NK, a fascist tyranny run by a criminally-insane madman won't wash.

1) Dissenters in NK are punished by execution or torture and extended stays in concentration camps.
Non-violent dissent is a right in the US.

2) The US avoids violence when it can.  NK systematically uses violence against its own citizens and is currently threatening many countries around the world with annihilation because they have criticized NK.

3) The US basically observes international law.  NK regularly breaks international law, especially UN sanctions.

4) NK is based upon autarky. The US trades globally.

5) Military service is compulsory in NK and voluntary in the US.

6) NK leadership is based upon a divine cult of personality. US politicians are political pinatas.

7) NK believes that Koreans are the master race. The US severely punishes racists.

NK is an awful dictatorship run by a fascist, lunatic thug.

The US is flawed, but good."

"The flaw is that Mr. Browne's death preceded  not only the 2008 financial crisis but also the collapse in interest rates.  His portfolio theory was crafted and ""tested"" during a period of relatively high interest rates, primarily the 70s, 80s, and 90s.

A weighting of 50% in T-bills & long bonds admittedly might provide downside protection but at what cost?  

I don't disagree with the notion of a permanent portfolio as it speaks to developing a sound investment strategy and sticking with it rather than being driven by panic.   But I think one also needs to be rationale and adapt over time.  For example at one time it made a lot more sense to hold T-bills when they were paying 3 or 4% and upwards of 10 - 12%..  Today they aren't even worth the bother.  There is arguably a stronger case for long bonds, but as mine have matured over the last 10 years I have sought more lucrative options.  If rates normalize I will adapt again - but certainly not at 50% fixed income."

"Since Nigel doesn't specify who the republicans he personally knows and who have said that, nor what they mean by it - I will speculate for you..

In this article, we see the direct labor cost increases that will effect the state.

If you take what ""republicans in general"" mean by ""the cost is far higher"" - you would have to do a little more math. Since zero skill jobs like gas station attendants, bussers at your local restaurants, and graveyard shift inventory stockers at your local grocery store would all have a higher cost of labor - and these employees create no increase in sales, productivity or efficiency just by being paid more - there will be tens of thousands of small businesses who have to raise prices to pay for the higher cost of labor.

It's forced inflation.

It has an exponential effect in every sector.

Sure, some people are ""paid more"" short term - but it will ""cost more"" for everyone long term."
"We certainly are creating some very new bedfellows with the new Administration.  Who would think that Kristoff would have any positive comments.

Know that, it should be no suprise that Kristoff would be defending Syrian citizens from the horrific treatment by their own leadership.

The missle attack will be seen as a long term success only if it leads us to a serious start of peace talks that would remove Assad from power.    I'm not at all sure that the United States is willing, or has the status, to broker such negotiations.

This country has the most diverse and qualified citizenry but it hasn't managed to produce a commensurate body of knowledge on where the world is and where it is going. 

Question: Can we name one book on China's politics and economics that has been written in Canada over the pasr decade that has been read and quoted beyond this country's borders? How about a myriad of other countries that are in the news on a daily basis such as the U.S., Russia, Iran, etc. Canada's emergence from its role as a colony must begin with a more visible presence in the world of ideas."

There was even a shock absorber between the cuff and the binding.  Price: $350. I don't know if many of these spacey-looking units ever sold. I was once descending from Rogers Pass lake near East Portal and overtook Ramer himself on one of these units. I don't think it was much help on this at times narrow and steep trail.

Unlikely -- if the MSM, generally speaking, has anything to do with it, providing cover for Trudeau's government.

First, since they are all in terribly declining business models, inflaming the situation to get viewership has been an absolute focus. Second, they are consumed with the subject at the expense of focusing on real issues and potential solutions and the pros and cons of those choices and solutions.

Can you see us having an Injections Site AND wrap-around services? I don't believe there will be funding for both. Why not use any proposed funding and increase needed detox/rehab facilities and sober living environments along with all the needed physical/mental health and social services.

The lesson here is simply the progressives are forcing too much of their agenda, too quickly and are not inclusive of the conservative core of the society they live in.

"There are a couple serious misconceptions in your post. 

First, you said ""most Canadians in their early earnings years are not earning high incomes, their marginal tax rate is low, so the tax deduction that RRSPs provide has low utility"". This is incorrect, because the deduction does not have to be used in the year of the contribution. They can be carried forward indefinitely until your marginal tax rate is higher if you desire to. 

Second, you said ""management expense ratios will help wipe out the real earnings of your fund"". If you purchase individual securities instead of mutual funds or ETFs it costs NOTHING to hold individual securities. In fact I could purchase $100K of a Canadian bank for $6.95, and hold it indefinitely for nothing more. 

You also mention inflation rates, which will be eclipsed by returns from 'sound' investments.

"PG-2 of my KM Post:
 What is not mentioned is that that pipeline was initially built to service local Vancouver oil companies. There were once several refineries here, but they left to WA state to process Alaska oil. Only Chevron remained, but KM wouldn't commit to continue supplying Chevron with oil. So oil by rail for Chevron has been travelling through populated White Rock, Crescent Beach  and New Westminster.   Very risky !!!
 KM should be continuing to commit a supply to Chevron, but KM was just for maximum profit, regardless of the risks to the GVRD.  I'm not surprised Chevron sold their refinery.
 So this pipeline is mainly to profit KM, regardless of it's poor location.
 I would expect this very poor oil route to increase the amount of oil shipped over many years, by increasing it's capacity.

I didn't vote for the NDP or Green parties, but I support their plan to stop the pipeline expansion as a better alternative.  I feel all shipping of oil on those routes should be stopped."

Tertullian believed that the sould was unique to each person AND that it came into being with the coming to be of the body.  ""Who is that man,

The pun on man is also a forced conclusion, because it was certainly intended to be ironic.  How can a ""the one one who WILL BE a man already BE a man""?  By being a man in two real senses:  Obviously, a fetus is not what we ordinarily think of when we think ""man.""

And bronze age zombie jew- welp, those are just facts. Except zombies aren't real! (Some might say ancient desert tribe with no knowledge of how reality works, rather than bronze age, but I don't think that's what you are really attempting to dispute.) When you perceive reality as a slur, you need to examine your beliefs. I suggest doing what Descartes did- doubt all that you believe to be true, *everything*."

"As the Minister of Information and Policy and Strategy advisor to the Hawaiian Kingdom I can state unequivocally and with full authority that the ""aquarium industry"" is in violation of one of the basic principles of Hawaiian culture, malama aina.

Malama aina has been a traditional socio-cultural practice of Hawaiians and ALL Polynesian peoples for many many thousands of years. Malama aina roughly translates as ""nurture and sustain what feeds and provides for us"". It means that we must act ethically, sustainably and on a subsistence basis at ALL times whenever we take food or resources from nature,

To do this we take from nature only what we need to sustain ourselves and NOTHING more and we do nothing that might effect the natural balance of all living things.

The ""aquarium industry"" violates this basic Hawaiian principle because it takes reef fish for monetary profit NOT for subsistence.

"""Which only goes to support my point that the European immigration situation is not the same as Canada's...""

Hello?

Um, no, that sentiment was neither stated nor implied in your original post.

What your original post actually did was to praise what you called Canada's doing ""a much better job of integrating other cultures"", implying that the European governments were at fault for societal clashes there. Your post amounted to a claim that Canada was outperforming the European countries  in the area of integrating cultures.

You never commented on the nature of people arriving in Europe. I did. And what I pointed out was that no, it is actually the job of Canada's immigration screens that best explain our higher level of peaceful harmony, not the job of Canada's integration efforts as you claimed.

You are welcome to agree with my observation, as you apparently now do, but it is sophistry for you to pretend that my observation was somehow part and parcel of your original post."

"The bottom line is that your vehicle is worth less after a claim.   Not the full amount but less than before.   This loss of value isn't covered.

It WILL affect your resale because many people will skip over vehicles with a large claim on Carproof - even if the damage was just cosmetic.   If they don't skip over the vehicle, then the claim will be used as leverage to get a better price.    As the seller, you can try to hold off, but in the end you are taking a risk that another buyer is out there who won't care about the claim.    If not, then you have to keep trying, or drop your price.

And the story about how a dealer sells a vehicle with a claim is a little unrealistic because the same dealer will lowball on buying the vehicle because of the claim - same as any other buyer.    They know the market, would NOT overpay so they have margin to play with.

Insurance companies will repair the damage, but you foot the bill for the loss of value."

"I'm sure Ibbitson has heard the Tories are choosing a new leader.  

And never did he say that the new leader must be a carbon copy of the former leader.

He simply presented his interesting analysis of what PM Harper might be thinking and whom he might be leaning towards in the choice of his successor.

And Ibbitson is right that the former PM will value highly the ability to unite the party and the country and the ability to be elected nationally.

I happen to agree that his possible preferences of O'Toole, Scheer and Bernier belong in the top tier.  And I would also add Raitt and Chong who would be better able to attract middle of the road voters and who have the most impressive back stories as the anti-Trudeaus who earned their credibility and successes themselves rather than inheriting them.

As for learning from their mistakes, I daresay that if they select a leader who returns them to power for a decade and provides outstanding leadership as Harper did, they'll be delighted."

"I think it's sad that whenever another random shooting happens it causes a massive argument, hate and fear about losing precious guns. Much of that hate is pointed in the wrong direction. If some gun owners are as hateful as they seem to be online we're all in danger. I think that the anger that's caused by arguing about guns with little regard to the victims of these crimes is causing more people to become violent. It's a very helpless feeling when another shooting happens. Some of us wonder what we'd do in a similar situation. Some of us believe that it could never happen to them, and some pray for victims. Some want fast justice which unfortunately is rare because of lengthy trials and appeals. There is no wrong emotion when reading the paper about another ""nice and quiet"" person who killed innocent people."

"You clearly don't understand that some companies are legally set up to distribute a larger percentage of cashflow to the shareholder or unit holder rather primarily because they don't require significant capital inputs to generate future revenue.  As a result dividend increases are less frequent or even rare compared to your traditional blue chip dividend stock.

While some of the businesses and sectors come with inherently more risk in exchange for the higher payout, many come with only marginally elevated risk.  The trade off in the later is generally less capital growth.

Many companies that have their origins in the former trust sector are based on this model.

But it is indeed amusing to listen to trader shun dividend investments because they are too risky."

"An understanding of the role of the SANDF in terms of its constitutional mandate is required before far fetched ideas of military detectives solving crime in the Cape are raised. 
Section 19.(1) of the Defence Act requires that the Defence Force may be employed in co-operation with the South African Police Service in terms of section 201(2)(a) of the Constitution in the prevention and combating of crime and maintenance and preservation of law and order within the Republic.
The President and Min of Defence and Police must specify where such deployments will occur plus other requirements of the Defence Act.
The SANDF may so deploy to the Cape Flats area but will do so based on an SAPS generated plan of operation with  CJOps operational inputs in respect of troop levels and possible tasks.
Those tasks would typically be assisting with cordons, protection of police road blocks and vehicle checkpoints plus combined patrols.  The police remain responsible for crime investigation."

You are so far out to lunch on this issue it's not even funny.  First of all, since when does someone who is committed to doing something about climate change have to hang up any and all possible links to carbon emissions?

You know how science has also shown how excessive fat and sugar are harmful for us?  Why don't you cut out ALL consumption of both, huh Gerry?  I guess you aren't that committed to health... See how dumb your original comment seems now?
The BEST business decision would have been to STAY in the Paris agreement.  That's why so many of our largest companies' CEOs came out against Trump's move to leave the agreement.

"This is consistent with the ruling on November 10, 2011,  when the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the decisions of the BC Supreme Court and the BC Court of Appeal to dismiss the claim of the Lax Kw'alaams First Nation (and other First Nations) for the right to a commercial fishery on the north coast of British Columbia.

The Court emphasized that care must be taken not to evolve an Aboriginal right into a modern right that is different than the Aboriginal right.  

 The court was clear that a ""gathering right"" to berries based on pre-contact times would not, for example, ""evolve"" into a right to ""gather"" natural gas within the traditional territory. The surface gathering of copper from the Coppermine River in the Northwest Territories in pre-contact times would not, I think, support an ""Aboriginal right"" to exploit deep shaft diamond mining in the same territory."

Why fund the CBC if all it can do is mimic its private competitors? Which is pretty much what it has done (and then not all that well) for the past 20 years or more. The fact a succession of prime ministers including and particularly Harper drastically cut the CBC's budget helps explain but does nothing to justify its failing performance.

"Here, from the Washington Post, is a great ""fake news"" story:

""The framed copy of Time Magazine was hung up in at least four of President Trump’s golf clubs, from South Florida to Scotland. Filling the entire cover was a photo of Donald Trump.

“Donald Trump: The ‘Apprentice’ is a television smash!” the big headline said. Above the Time nameplate, there was another headline in all caps: “TRUMP IS HITTING ON ALL FRONTS . . . EVEN TV!”

""This cover — dated March 1, 2009 — looks like an impressive memento from Trump’s pre-presidential career. To club members eating lunch, or golfers waiting for a pro-shop purchase, it seemed to be a signal that Trump had always been a man who mattered. Even when he was just a reality-TV star, Trump was the kind of star who got a cover story in Time.

""But that wasn’t true.

""The Time cover is a fake.

""There was no March 1, 2009, issue of Time Magazine. And there was no issue at all in 2009 that had Trump on the cover."""
"The headline does not correspond with the content in the article and specifically to what Coach Leavitt has to say on the matter.

Headline: Lamar Winston planning to make his first start on defense for Oregon Ducks at Wyoming

Article: Leavitt said he’s not sure if Winston will open the game against the Cowboys. “We have different personnel groups so I don’t know if he’ll start or not, it depends on who goes out there,” he said.

From the article it appears the defense in an ongoing state of competition and we can expect, injuries aside, to see different people inserted as starters based on practice performances.

"Putz, I am well aware that this is a federal program and Alaska's role in it was aided by our Washington delegation. State taxes could be paid, but you might have to pay taxes as well. Your contempt for our youth is matched by their contempt for older parasites like you.Keep writing for the uninformed who read and believe your drivel."

"A third term for Obama?  Yeah!  More Muslim prayer rugs and transgender dressing in the military, more national debt--let's go for $50T.  Fewer to no Christian crosses and crèches anywhere.   More inedible school lunches,.  More unemployed and underemployed.  More bypassing the U.S. Constitution.  More freebies for the masses supported by more taxes for working people.  More tribes--class tribes, racial tribes, generation tribes, gender tribes, gender identity tribes.  More big government control of everything because we, the people, are too stupid to decide what's best for us in our own towns and states.  More hypocrisy--""do what I say but the rules don't apply to me and my political kind.""  More straw men, so many we will think we are a nation of scarecrows.  I am so weary of having my intelligence insulted virtually every time Obama opens his mouth.  It's incredibly sad that so many people don't realize when they being called stupid."

Dryenema - What is funny in my post and what is incorrect in what I said?
"Definition of mob rule: control of a political situation by those outside the conventional or lawful realm, typically involving violence and intimidation.  Taken in context with the rest of your post referencing the ""hazards of tyranny,"" I would say I understand the intent of the phrase, ""mob rule.""   Are you comparing the peaceful march in Seattle to people hanging blacks from streetlights?  I'm not sure how you can draw any comparison between the two.  Women began fighting for the right to vote in 1848 when they started to organize nationally and convene women's conferences all over the US.  They organized parades, pickets and marches.  They were beaten, jailed and went on hunger strikes.  To suggest that after 72 years of fighting, women were given the right to vote because of the intellect of the Republican party is an ignorant conclusion that ignores the years of struggle and pressure women put on both the president and the congress."
"Why did the trooper pull that bus over?  It was because of the call.  The traffic stop was for probable cause, and the Trooper still let the guy off for things that the rest of Alaska would have never gotten a pass for..   

This state became a one party state after 2010, after we were monitored closely as part of the Voting Rights Act for the kind of corruption that has happened here for decades. 

Don't be naive.  Do you recall 2006 and how most of the CBC got reelected? The AST has allegedly always done favors for folks like Frank Bailey with political connections in Alaska, most famously against Mike Wooten, Palin's ex-brother-in-law,  in the national AST embarrassment that became ""Troopergate"".  

See ""frozen justice"" and several other alaska corruption blogs  that  sprang up since the CBC shenanigans came to light in 2005.   I'm not ""bashing Republicans""--- I'm bashing a police force **known** to do favors for politicians in power (check) i.e. the  famously corrupt Alaska GOP."
Did the story say otherwise?  How is it fake?

"Actually, people with DB or any pensions CAN split their income with their spouse, its called pension splitting.  

But, its now dirty for a small business person (who's has been saving in their company since that was their pension) to split their income."

"You're right. They should show up at the fairgrounds so Trump supporters can beat them up for the pleasure of the Trump overlord. Seriously? NOT showing up at the fairgrounds is exactly what they should do. Calling them ""hateful and narrow-minded"" is truly rich."

"Not to nit-pick... OK, yes, to nit-pick.  Guiness is beer, but an ale not a lager.  I do like Guiness' flavor, but prefer the higher ABV stouts like Olvisholt Brughus (spelling?) imperial stout.  I won't fault you for being a Guiness fan, however, it's a classic."
"Exactly, it's just like Christians that feel compelled to proselytize, I say do what you want, be what you want, believe what you want, but please - don't share, keep it to yourself."
"Human beings don't do a good job of ""observing"" the universe either. Our senses and our minds are adapted to life at one and only one particular scale, and at only a small range of EM frequencies and sound wave frequencies, and at a very idiosyncratic experience of the passage of time (in spite of the sophistication of some of our highfalutin scientific equations, which in any case are not true ""knowledge,"" nor are they the common property of all human beings). Other kinds of animals are far superior to human beings at observing other aspects of the universe, which must remain quite beyond our comprehension and even our imagining.

As for Plato, inasmuch as he was a child of his time, he gets caught up in a lot of passing interests and suppositions which a Platonist ""after a fashion"" such as myself has no need to commit himself to. What's essential remains as true as ever."
