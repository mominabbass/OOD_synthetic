"Republicans are discovering how difficult governing is after years of just saying ""no.""  The majority of them have been repeatedly voting to repeal obamacare like zombies without brains.  Their only coherent argument for repealing the health care law seemed to be that it was because they said they would for the past seven years.  Beyond that, they had no plan and still don't.  To make matters worse, their ignorant leader in the white house also didn't know anything about policy and the legislative process.  Sad!!!"

Make no mistake though, Mike is trying to drag this out and get as many big names involved (Metzger, Rogan, Cumia, McInness) so his truly awful self involved hate podcast will get numbers.  He claims he cares about these issues but it's definitely about only about his ego.  Just look at this Mancow wannabe and his dumb golf putter trying to look all hard. Super cringy."

She was an unfaithful sleeze. She made a vow and did not keep it. She couldn't keep her legs shut. She completely destroyed her hard working man because of her sexual addiction and welcomed a man other than her husband into her bed. Of course he lost it. He goes to work while she shares there marriage bed with a low life scumbag. Those kids belong with his family not hers. Who knows how sleazy that sister is. She is probably after the PFDs and probably is just as sleazy.
Wait for it... here comes da tweet with the words loser and low ratings.
"Waters has done NOTHING for her 'constituents'. She IS a master politician though, continually convincing the dumb and helpless that 'A vote for Maxine' will make their lives better. Those lives have never gotten better, and they wont be. She's convincing in her lies when she tells them that all of their lives are bad because of Whitie. Her race-baiting skills are amazing. 
PS. Her mansion is closer to $4,000,000, but you're right, it's not in her district. She's become too elitist (like all good liberals), to live with her voting masses..."
"oh, zinkie's FEELINGS are hurt because one of her favorite 'minorities' can'ta  live in fantasy world and BE SUPPORTED BY THE US TAXPAYERS!

So why do we need such useless deviants  in the military if they can't perform mission one???  But zinky wants to FEEL GOOD.  and zinkie felt so good using her gutter language in writing about President Trump.   Here's a suggestion for zinky: go find yourself another country that's living in a fantasy world of your preference."

Same as the Republican Party.  Both are built on racism and hatred.  You know this.
"The Republican Party is tripping over themselves trying to distance themselves from the Alt Right. It's all lip service. The Aryan Nation Party (GOP) pitched a hissy fit when the Obama administration tried to put white supremacist groups on the terrorists watch list. It is the their white trash president that for more than eight years demanded to see President Obama's birth certificate. It was their white trash congress that obstructed at every turn, even denying President Obama's Supreme Court nominee for nearly a year. It was because he was the first Black President. No the Republican / Aryan Nation Party owns this. No amount of lip service will suffice. It is time to call out the entire party. The entire Republican Party, every single Republican voter all the way up to the party heads, has the blood of this weekend on their hands."

"The increasing use of online education means that some of the smaller campuses are no longer needed. These campuses typically have very limited course choice, and thus stream students into programs that they may not want or the community may not need. Where programs need hands-on experience (auto mechanics, for instance) students will have to leave communities that can't support reasonable enrollment. That might require student aid to provide grants rather than loans to students in remote communities. It is still likely that there will be net savings and improved education quality."

Why does Knight give $ to both Democrats and Republicans?
"Proponents of government-funded programs almost always state that there is no “fat” to cut from their programs and in fact need more money.  However, as a taxpayer, I do not think spending $697,177 by the National Science Foundation (a federally funded organization) on a play about climate change as lean muscle – and I think most Americans would agree that if there is enough money to hand out grants like this, then their budgets can be reduced (or at least not further grown)."
Gold medal in idiocy. What an embarrassment.
"No, it's you who's been thoroughly discredited here. You either don't understand what you're looking at or purposely misrepresent it. Either way, you've been owned.

Typical hypocrisy from the social justice warriors, push junk science and mediocrity like womens studies, or LGBT studies or forced native lobby indoctrination.  There's a reason they hate math and science and focus on stupidity like this, they take the money from the kids that work hard and find employment, and hand them to idiots who choose to demand things from everyone else under the guise of 'equity', lets call it what it is, Communism and Totalitarianism.

"They're moving a lot of these people into the private seniors' housing sector without consideration of the impacts of this strategy. The private residences aren't being compensated for the additional burden of providing health care services in these settings. The whole thing reminds me of the deinstitutionalization of mental health care a few decades ago, where seriously ill people were dumped into communities without adequate supports being put in place to care for them. What happened? Predictably, we're seen increases in chronic homelessness as well as the incarceration of the mentally ill. That's worked out well, hasn't it?"
I wish the officers had been able to use force and knock a few of those homeless thugs in the face...

"Bye Felicia. Faried is not a starter in the current NBA. The current NBA is about floor spacing, passing, and perimeter shooting, 3 things he's terrible at doing. Faried is useless when more than 10 feet from the basket and is awful at defense. His weaknesses have been holding the Nuggets back at the PF position for the last few years (nobody noticed because the team was terrible). If Faried truly believes he's still a starter, it will be a rude awakening when he's traded and is only given 10-15 minutes a game by his new coach. He's an undersized ""energy guy"" aka a bench player to any decent team. His agent needs to explain the reality of his role in today's NBA."

So at one point one section of GS was making huge profits off the losses of another section. People did not know what to do? They benefitted from the bailout and became a more normal bank, regulated by the government and everything. So whatever happened in 1998 was pretty much wiped out in 2008."

How can they spend money on counselors when class sizes are so astronomical? I agree that mental health is important, and I'd love to see full-time counselors on staff at every school. Unlike the scoffers below (Calling Balderas names like a grade-school bully isn't advancing your argument), I understand that there are children who come to school with deep issues that make learning extremely difficult. It'd be nice if all parents did a good job, but many of them don't, and we still want their kids to be productive members of society. We're stuffing them in loud, overcrowded classrooms, and it's not helping them or their peers, and it's burning out the teachers. 4J knows class size is of huge importance to parents, but they continue to blame schools and ignore parents.

"""....taxi permit owners threatened to sue over the loss of value of their permits and warned the quality of service would decline as cabbies struggled to make ends meet....""
Quality of service?  From an Anchorage cab? Ha! I just took a cab home from the airport and the taxi was pretty dirty/smelly and the rear passenger door couldn't be opened from the inside (slightly scary as a woman, in my opinion), oh and he ran a red light (sigh).  However, my taxi driver was very nice and a great conversationalist, which I did appreciate. Any investment is a risk, if the value of the permit declines, its a risk taken as with any investment. I welcome more competition...I welcome UBER, which I hope will encourage our taxis to have clean/nice/safe vehicles. I shouldn't have to say a little  prayer before I get in an Anchorage cab, but I do. Every. Single. Time."

Anyone with a minimum of intelligence and personal dignity is offended by these cretins who make all Americans look backward and mentally deficient. 
It really depends on how you define ""everyday Americans"" and if you look at Hillary's platform, that is, the policies she has stated on record that she intends to pursue when she becomes president, I say, I don't care who someone said they think Hillary hates as long as she actually tries to implement the non-rich people-friendly policies she has crafted in her policy statements. 
Seriously, what's the option--voting for Republicans? These people are always saying how much they love average Americans while they stab them in the back supporting policies that favor only the rich. The policies favored by Republicans are a matter of public record."

Be it liberals or conservatives, we have to draw a line somewhere; this country has no place for Nazism, White Supremacy and racism. We just have to stand up against such bigotries.

They are over-paid anyway - why do we pay them hundreds of thousands while paying teachers, cops and firefighters fractions of that - and people who risk their lives every day at work can't protest and make a fraction of what these protesting jerks make for working part of a year.

The corruption in the Democrat party really knows no boundaries, and  is constantly pushing the envelope further and further to the left.  Sad and such an embarrassment to Hawaii.

The government of Canada has proven over and over again that there is no way they can stop a disaster from happening.  They are always in reaction mode.

Someone has to fix this mess, or it's off the rails in another year. Costs have tripled since its inception and it's not available as more pull out of the markets. At minimum, now that the ball is rolling, the demos will have to participate in the senate or explain why to their idiots back home that sent them.

"That the benefit would not be worth the cost is clear to any intelligent person, but we’re talking about a State that voted for Trump. Alaska is fast becoming the Appalachia of the north.  Seems Trump voters are eager to return Alaska to full colony status, where we are only good for supplying the rest of the United states - and other countries - with our resources, for which we get little to nothing. Then when Alaska has been sucked dry by outside interests, we’ll be left with the ugly, broken, empty shell.  And who’s helping to do this? Our very own senators, legislators and Mallot, both of whom expect to get rewarded handsomely.  
Of course, the very same morons who voted for Trump also voted for the Republicans Gand semi-blue idiots who voted for Mallot.  These Alaskans - if you can them that - have no pride or backbone. They are pigs at the trough of our destruction. For shame."

"One thing that I don't see in any press on this subject is the impact of a big minimum wage hike on the cost of child care.  Lots of child care workers earn a lot less than $13/hour.  I think all child care workers are undervalued and should earn far more than they do, but I don't know many families who can afford to pay significantly more for child care. Infant care in a center costs around $1200 a month now.  A big wage hike would push that cost up by hundreds of dollars a month, as the biggest expense most child care centers have is wages.  I think we'll see a lot of mothers pushed out of the labor force by the jump in child care costs.  Combine the loss of an income with generally higher costs for goods and services, and this minimum wage hike will hit middle class families hard.   I have yet to see Kotek or anyone else explain how families are going to manage the increased cost of child care, and I haven't seen anyone in the press ask them to."

What would Jerry Prevo think about that story? Exactly what I think about his....
The university could have attempted such a ban if they wanted to have one (though it would have failed in any legal test it faced).  The city touted using the money for all sorts of 'good health and wellness programs' for its residents including several areas right near the university.  Unsurprisingly the city also targeted the area around the University in its efforts to get the tax approved.   Basically the sales job amounted to you will get all these things and someone else will pay for them.  Now it turns out that those students that were so stoked to get all that free stuff that someone else would pay for... will be paying for all that free stuff elsewhere in the city.  The university makes up 25% of the total tax to be collected.  So rather than being the recipients of 'other peoples money' they are instead the 'other people' paying for all the projects elsewhere in the city.

The GDP of the USA under Obama has been less than 2% actually closer to 1.3%.

First I'll say I'm not opposed to the pipeline, but I am opposed to it's location right through the middle of the GVRD.  The current route puts many people in great danger, even though KM have altered over 50% of the route to improve it. When it was initially built over 60 years ago, that region wasn't very populated  and there was only the occasional oil tanker travelling through the harbour.
 My suggestion is why doesn't the pipeline stay on the south side of the Fraser River, then go on the flat delta land to the Roberts Bank docks?  I was very pleased when I was told by a KM person at an open house, they also felt that route was best, but they said it would be much more difficult than just expanding the current route. Even the premier of AB suggested that route a few years ago.
 So the pipeline will go in the wrong location because it is an easier procedure !

"These standardized test cost millions of dollars -- there are the test writers (often people who didn't like teaching, so now they design tests), the software engineers (who earn double the salary of most teachers), the graders (who are paid pennies to pour over free-response questions) and a lot of others who administer the production, market, train and make presentations on these tests.
I wonder how much could be saved if we did away with these bloated tests  OR  how much class sizes could  be reduced if this money went to hire more teachers?  
Tests that have been used for years are available with fewer hours required for their administration and are of better quality.  We're re-invented the wheel and put it on every student, everywhere, all the time."
Sorry that you voted for Lisa and she has disappointed you.  She'd been in office for several years before her latest election.  It was clear to me that she would  pretend to be independent as long as the election was on going and then return to Lisa-GOP lite and ALWAYS vote for the GOP agenda after the election.   If this surprised you then you were not paying attention to her previous behaviors.

I think the Greens are reading too much into this win.  Many people like me voted Green because of the extreme corporate bias of the Liberals and on the other hand the undue influence of big labour on the NDP.  Anyone not aligned with these camps goes unrepresented. Andrew Weaver promised he would look at each situation and use an evidence based approach in making decisions.  That should have translated into taking the most rational and progressive portions of any issue. Unfortunately after the election the big lobby groups in the environment and labour pulled out all the stops and we instead have an NDP/Green alliance.   The pundits are underestimating the numbers who voted for the Greens out of protest of the other parties and the promise to shine a light on the business of government.

"Important hours that should be dedicated to the far more important core subject areas are eroded by frivolous things like Treaty Education in Saskatchewan. Is the STEM push going to erode things further if students aren't required to put in more hours to ensure we don't sacrifice the fundamental basics?

The government mandated that there had to be outcomes and indicators taught around Treaty Education but never provided the hours needed so teachers are strained trying to find ways to incorporate the outcomes in other subject areas which primarily fall within the far more important core subjects.

Is it any wonder why Saskatchewan's 2015 OECD PISA results were the lowest in the country when testing skills and knowledge for Math, Reading, and Science.

I certainly put STEM ahead of Treaty Education as far as importance but the only solution I see is mandating students to more instructional hours to cover all this frivolous stuff to ensure the core subjects aren't eroded any further."

And yes there are plenty of Canadian tech workers who would probably meet 80% of Mr. Alaire's hiring criteria but they would also have to fork out more cash like you would do in a normal economy - i.e. where supply and demand of resources is not inelastic!  So you have people like Mr. Alaire and others blurting out their sob story where they can't find tech talent. 20 years ago when we didn't have so much immigration, you met maybe 70% of the hiring criteria and the rest you learned.  After the decades of massive immigration we now have corporations addicted to cheap foreign labour at the xpense of Canadians.

Construction started April of this year, and the plant will be fully operational with tertiary treatment by 2020.  Although there were rumblings of community advocacy on this issue as early as the 60s, if we look at the organized campaign that started in 2004, it took 16 years to see this campaign through to the end and to finally stop the practice of discharging 150 million liters (or approx. 40 million gallons) of untreated sewage effluent daily into the coastal waters that surround Vancouver Island and make up the northern border of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State.""

During the school year, the children may only be in school from nine to three, but the teachers are there before and after.  And they take work home or come into the school to work on weekends.

"That's a good point Baluqtaq. Overpopulation is THE driver behind environmental degradation. Every person puts a little more pressure on the world's resources. Some more than others, yes, but pressure nonetheless. It's a subject that is rarely discussed because it is ""uncomfortable"" since it cuts right into the premise that it is a basic human right to pump out as many children as desired. Its fine to have one or two kids, to replace your own number. Even three is a defendable number (giving  a ""spare"", so to speak). But a couple generating four (or more) children is indefensible, other than to say ""it's their right"". I have tremendous respect for the family in the article, simply amazing and obviously wonderful people. But if every couple had as many children as they, then the environment would be in even more trouble than it already is. Luckily for their home nation as well as many other developed nations, many couples make the responsible choice of having just one (or none at all)."

"That is a red herring.  In fact Wente's observations are right on the mark.  I grew up in a small town in rural Ontario, and I now live in a larger wealthier expensive city.  The economy of scale is definitely much lower there - cost of living much lower (housing cost is 1/3 of the city I now live in), opportunities very limited, wages much lower, unemployment is higher too.  It makes no sense for government to impose wage cutoff uniform to the entire province, when these smaller rural economies cannot handle it.  Those small towns operate fine on their own lower-revenue economy.  Everyone is poorer, but the lifestyle is perhaps better due to low cost of living, without the need for government fracking up the economic balance and the business models of wee shops."

Hard fast line drives can and do injure pitchers. And hard fast line drives into (basically) field-level seats get from the plate to the seats in just a second or so.....hardly enough time for even an attentive person to react if other spectators are moving in and out of the way to either try to catch or get away from the hard fast line drive. 
-
I don't sit in the (basically) field level seats down the first and third base lines simply because I am aware of the fact that hard fast foul balls can and do get hit in those areas frequently. That is why I choose seats higher up. The view is better and the foul balls ""lob"" into those areas more, giving people extra seconds to react properly.

So while proper attention is paramount, netting would help...a lot."

Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.

The last two big studies that made the media rounds on vaccines and autism were Industry funded..
    We all know vaccines work very good.  But the down side is completely ignored,  and controlled by the Industry.  Until we admit there is a problem we will never fix it.

"As one who participated in the march in Seattle on January 21, I find Mark Miloscia's comments extremely offensive. I marched for comprehensive reproductive health care for all women. I marched for the rights of immigrants. I marched for the rights of the disabled, for the rights of Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans, and all Americans.  I marched for the rights of all individuals to practice their faith as they see fit. If you were to read your history books, you would learn that this county was not founded by Christians, but by Unitarians and Deists. I marched to protest sexism, racism, and sexual assault. I marched for the survivors of sexual assault. I marched for better education and comprehensive health care. Are these causes un American?
 
Since when is exercising my right to peacefully assemble and speak freely un American? Have you read the constitution recently?

"I'll take  shot. CDF has a long and checkered history, but at least since the appointment of then-Cardinal Ratzinger (1981), has become less pastoral and more juridical-canonical. Pope Francis inherited as Prefect Cardinal Mueller, who has a pastoral side, but leans heavily toward the juridical-canonical work of the Congregation. By appointing Cardinal O'Malley, Pope Francis adds a pastoral voice that echoes throughout many parts of the Catholic world. In this sense, he appears to be sending a signal that he wants CDF to be more pastoral and that, if necessary, he will replace Mueller.
Some commentators in Rome believe O'Malley is Francis' choice to succeed him, in which case a position in CDF would help make his case in a future conclave."

"""...but now that Donald Trump is President the genre is essential, excoriating viewing"".
---------------------------
Just why is it essential viewing? I know Trump is an unbearable idiot so why would I need to watch a show mocking him? And to be perfectly honest, what sort of person derives their political information and opinion from a comedy show. 

In a recent article, the son of Neil Postman wrote a column suggesting his father's polemic, ""Amusing Ourselves to Death"", predicted the rise of a figure like Donald Trump. 
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/john-doyle-fixed-target-of-a-trump-administration-has-tv-satire-soaring/article33910624/comments/

But there is the flip side of Postman's prescient warning: those trapped in a television existence in which comedy becomes knowledge and the act of laughing at satire as protest - or worse - conceived as political action."
"APD is not overwhelmed. The DA's office might be but to APD this is what they love, believe  it or not. I found them to be fair and reasonable the few times they had to deal with me. I'm sorry to say me, but oh well the truth sets us free. Or puts us in jail....."

"I certainly agree that this article reads as if the author has some sort of personal problem with Blake. That is why I saw it more as a shock value piece than that of a real review because Dan's other reviews, for or against a place, don't seem to have the same animosity. Many others pointed it out as well but those comments have all been taken down.  Some of those commenters I'm sure knew Blake but I don't believe all of them did. Of course there is no way to say whether or not Dan does indeed know Blake on a personal level and if there is any discontent in that way but I would have to say that if it were at all true and Dan willingly used his journalistic power to attack Blake and his establishment then it is a truly unprofessional move and should be looked into by the Globe and Mail. It would be nice if Dan could clear the air on this one for all of us that are either in favour of the restaurant or not."

"...That way the developer that is profiting is also contributing to the long term viability and attractiveness of the city..

"Numerous factors. The fatigue regulations in Canada are decades behind other developed nations. Example: 10 years ago I met a Continental airlines crew, who were flying from Houston, Texas, to San Jose, Costa Rica, and had to lay over in Costa Rica because the flight hours were too long for them to fly to Costa Rica and back to Houston in one day legally under U.S. regulations. At that time (and probably still today), Air Canada pilots flew from Toronto to  San Jose, Costa Rica and back in a single day, with only 2 pilots, the same thing U.S. carriers couldn't do from Houston. Have a look at that on the map. 
  So many more factors, most of which cannot be posted here."

Same deal with Trudeau and Trump.    But Trump has clearly not acted in his country's best interests.   In 8 months he has pandered to JUST his core  support and has reduced the U.S. President's stature to that of an international joke as well as increased divisions in his own country (and party).

My duties included management reform analysis, overseaing the Office of Emergency Preparedness and did anything having to do with that representing the Mayor's Office (including table top exercises for snow emergencies), helping the Mayor draft testimony on the management reform process to Congress, as well as additional-funding requirements, working with Congress on urgent items having to do with congressional earmarks, analyzing and recommending employee appeals on payroll and other issues to the Deputy Mayor, when the Mayor does a public event, dealing with constituent action items (I had more to do than public safety), putting together the selection process for the new chief of police, etc."

The night club dropped the ball as well, not having metal detectors to protect their customers as they are a ""gun free zone."" If a place of business or government building chooses or is required to be a gun free zone, then it is their responsibility to provide adequate protection. The problem is not gun control, the problem is insecure gun free zones that only prevent law abiding citizens from bringing fire arms and or protection at gun free venues/locations.

"I agree. I don't see much if any improvement in Siemian...the problem is I don't see much improvement in the line so everything he does is still under pressure. Same line...same Siemain. Goff was considered a bust for awhile. But here is the difference. When Goff was handed the job he kept it and never looked back. He inspired a new coaching staff to dump Kase Keenum and keep him as the starter. Paxton Lynch has not come close to doing anything even close to that. When Siemian was injured and the Broncos played Lynch, he couldn't hold onto the gig and Siemian had to play even when he less than 100%. His 2nd year with a new coaching staff he was again handily beaten out by the incumbent. I think the comparisons to Goff are unwarranted. Goff had a slow start but now is firmly in control. Lynch? He might not even have his job as a second stringer firmly in his grasp. If Siemian doesn't show improvement the Broncos are in trouble because there is nothing on the bench.

"Trump is an ugly speaking man - no question.  Tabloid entertainment in US whether acting under the guise of news media, reality tv, or talk shows, has lend itself to electing such a man to be President.

What I still cannot believe is how the Globe editors and journalist are in such denial that they are complicit in the ugliness.  First, since they are all in terribly declining business models, inflaming the situation to get viewership has been an absolute focus. Second, they are consumed with the subject at the expense of focusing on real issues and potential solutions and the pros and cons of those choices and solutions. 

Doyle quoted ""The Truth"".  Here is the truth, the vast majority of us are discounting everything your saying since its just so one sided and never ending.

In fact, he wanted to cripple the other parties since the CPC (at the time) had a fundraising advantage.

So long as the CPC and its supporters remain the party of Harper, then Harper will be relevant."

"Portugal is held up as the gold standard for ""decriminalizing"" drugs and not ""judging"" the addict. Their programs has some success due to wrap-around services and is mandatory. Drug dealing is still illegal and dealt with harshly. Other EU countries tried to emulate the program. With the 2008 recession, their budgets were slashed for the addicts in program and caused overdoses, increased crime, and increased disease transmission, increased homelessness. Can you see us having an Injections Site AND wrap-around services? I don't believe there will be funding for both. Why not use any proposed funding and increase needed detox/rehab facilities and sober living environments along with all the needed physical/mental health and social services. The way I see it, Injections Sites are prolonging the suffering and misery of the addict with the usual end result of death. Which would be more compassionate?"
"""Will voters notice Trudeau’s use of ‘ominous bills'?""
Unlikely -- if the MSM, generally speaking, has anything to do with it, providing cover for Trudeau's government. For example, during yesterday's CBC Power Panel, the media panelist claimed to have read the bill and agreed with the Liberal 'strategist-cum-apologist' that the bill dealt with implementation of the budget, all measures related to finances. Funny that. It seems she read a totally different bill than Mr. Ibbitson read."

"The current contract in place with the NFLPA does have some limits in it for what the teams and league can do for discipline. Although it already allows discipline against many behaviors that damage the league, so this might fit within that.

"Trump wants private investors to basically direct $1 trillion in infrastructure projects nationwide through a “revenue neutral” financing plan, which banks on financing from private investors, allegedly to control deficit spending (which the GOP generally deems wasteful, while promoting tax breaks as a wiser redistribution of public funds into corporate coffers). To draw some $167 billion to jumpstart the $1 trillion, 10-year infrastructure plan, Washington would grant a giant tax break “equal to 82 percent of the equity amount.” The goal isn’t fixing bridges so much as fixing the corporate tax codes to promote privatization and unregulated construction with virtually no public input."

"Actually, the Mayor of San Juan is a more experienced elected official and public servant than Donald J. Trump. 

She held her first press conference on the afternoon of the hurricane after herself having accompanied City officials making preliminary assessments of the damage, and specifically addressed the total obliteration of the housing built along the Martin Pena Canal.

 She is absolutely right in pointing out that the island is only 100 miles by 35 miles, and that by now, basic relief supplies (water, fuel, food) could and should have reached any point on the island by appropriately sized military helicopter. 

She is showing better, smarter leadership than the thin skinned, sociopathic Trump."

"Ljundgren writes that “[t]wo of the three measures of core inflation, which the Bank of Canada introduced last year, posted gains”, including CPI-common, which the BoC tended to push the hardest, which rose from 1.3% to 1.4%. However, surely this is hardly a strong point in favour of the BoC’s interest rate hike. In June 2015, the month before the BoC dropped the overnight rate interest rate from 0.75% to 0.5%, CPI-common was at 1.6%. The average of the three new measures was 1.5% in June 2015 as opposed to only 1.4% in June 2017. Journos like Lundgren seem to have completely forgotten the old CPIX measure of inflation since the 2016 renewal agreement plutoed it but it hasn’t gone away. In June 2015 it was sitting at 2.3%, above the target rate of inflation; in June 2017, it was at 0.9%, below the 1% lower bound. Poloz seems to have divorced his interest rate decisions almost completely from the inflation concerns that are supposed to dictate them."

"The environmentalists have outlawed HFCs....HFCs are 1% of our emissions , one unit of HFT emission is equal to up to 14,000 units of CO2 emission per Environment Canada. The average  HFT unit is 1,000 times as damaging as one unit of CO2 equivalent. CO2 equals 78% of our GHG emissions. So, one unit of HFT times 1,000 versus 78 units times 1. Elimination of HFTs eliminates 95% of the GHG problem re global warming. That is the point that Kerry was making. To drive my point even further, the model that predicted doom and gloom assumed global HFT emissions increasing from 1% to 19% by 2050. Shake up all your brain cells and join the dots. Neither US EPA or Environment Canada are disputing the above."
"I've always thought that the concept of the Golden Rule is, if not specifically voiced, certainly implied in the teachings of all religions...including Christianity.  As an agnostic and secular humanist I don't ""tie"" it to any religion.  I simply feel it's a wonderful test to apply to one's actions.  Are you suggesting that Jesus did NOT teach us to be non-judgmental and to look at our own faults and work to be better people.  You confuse me with your response.  Over the years I've seen the actions of some self-professed Christians and asked myself ""do these people believe in the Golden Rule""?  Are you suggesting that Christians shouldn't follow that simple rule?  Help me out on this one.  Thanks, Gary Crum"

Having seen a batch of kittens die from eating bad clams, it's not anything I would want to experience!
When it comes right down to it, oyster farming is like farming wheat or other crops. Sometimes nature attacks crops with a blight or grasshoppers and farmers loose whole fields. 
Hopefully, oyster farming in Southeast Alaska will fare better then the farmers in the Mid-west have.
Farming is a tough job! Hard way to make a living at times but can be a very good way of making a living as long as you are prepared ahead of time for the bad times and can wait them out L"
"A high school would know that it is now climate change and not ""global warming"" as there is poor evidence of global warming but significant evidence of climate change.   It always  has.

"The author's assumptions about spending by retired baby boomers are off-base. Just because they know how to spend money doesn't mean they will continue to do so once retired. When retirees in their 60s (like me) are faced with fixed costs like property taxes and condominium fees  that are rising faster than their pension incomes do, naturally they will tend to reduce variable expenses wherever they can. Many others are falling back mainly on their savings (RRSPs and other) to fund their retirements, are searching desperately for better investment yields and don't have indexed pensions apart from CPP and OAS. Carrick should speak with some financial advisers who actually deal with retirees in their 60s - he might learn something from them."

"The dominant trait that drives the modern conservative is a bitter, unhinged hatred of all things liberal. So unhinged is this hatred that the mass shootings themselves aren't the problem, rather it's the push by liberals for legislative action in response.

Universal background checks or restrictions on automatic weapons? Nope because they wouldn't have prevented the Vegas killings. If it can't be proven that any new law or regulation would have prevented Vegas or Sandyhook or Orlando etc etc then the conservative is dead set against it. 

Since you've blocked every proposed solution for the last 25 years, this is on you, conservatives. Let's hear your solutions. And remember conservatives, by your own standards, every proposed idea must guarantee that it would have prevented Vegas...so don't bother with the ""if only more citizens were armed"" thing."

All these African Countries completely fell apart upon the departure of the whites who brought much Knowledge and development to the Whole Continent. Most Africans hate ""Colonialism"" but ALL want and LIVE with ALL it's benefits, all things modern was brought by the ""Colonialists"" and Africa is living it ,whether they  want to admit  it or not.

"Fair question.  Students, in the process of acquiring an education, learn skills and coping strategies.  Many students with challenges will ultimately develop strategies to work efficiently, albeit differently than the norm.  Their work is not ""less than"",  just produced differently.   Student support is also about facilitating strategies and developing self-advocacy.  My point with the tech sector is that employers, by being open to unusual work practices, get the creative and excellent output they need, when they need it, though the process often looks very non-traditional, even chaotic.   

 I have no issue with the fact that certain work environments require specific skills.  Part of transitioning to the workforce is the fact that ALL students, regardless of ability, need to match their skill set with work.  My point is that by accommodating kids who learn differently we give them a better chance to develop skills that could prove valuable- we just need to step outside the box."
"When next step was first built it had no laundry. We brought in Laundry machines later. First the electric, plumbing and hot water had to be upgraded to handle it.

If you build walls then you also kill the air circulation, and would need to spend even more to keep the place cooler. Also, consider that you are fully comfortable in a box (walls) many of the people moving in have been living on the street a while and some are seriously not comfortable being enclosed in a box. Same, when next step first opened up, we had residents move in and then could not sleep in their cubicles, and instead slept in the parking lot next to the doors for a while, or slept in the larger more open common spaces of the shelter.

Surely laziness, apathy, and a dead end dead beat lifestyle has nothing to do with that. It's obviously the 1% to blame. What Junior fails to grasp is simply put, let's trade homeless for homeless.

"PG-2 of my KM Post:
 What is not mentioned is that that pipeline was initially built to service local Vancouver oil companies. There were once several refineries here, but they left to WA state to process Alaska oil. Only Chevron remained, but KM wouldn't commit to continue supplying Chevron with oil. So oil by rail for Chevron has been travelling through populated White Rock, Crescent Beach  and New Westminster.   Very risky !!!
 KM should be continuing to commit a supply to Chevron, but KM was just for maximum profit, regardless of the risks to the GVRD.  I'm not surprised Chevron sold their refinery.
 So this pipeline is mainly to profit KM, regardless of it's poor location.
 I would expect this very poor oil route to increase the amount of oil shipped over many years, by increasing it's capacity.

I didn't vote for the NDP or Green parties, but I support their plan to stop the pipeline expansion as a better alternative.  I feel all shipping of oil on those routes should be stopped."
"There are a couple serious misconceptions in your post. 

First, you said ""most Canadians in their early earnings years are not earning high incomes, their marginal tax rate is low, so the tax deduction that RRSPs provide has low utility"". This is incorrect, because the deduction does not have to be used in the year of the contribution. They can be carried forward indefinitely until your marginal tax rate is higher if you desire to. 

Second, you said ""management expense ratios will help wipe out the real earnings of your fund"". If you purchase individual securities instead of mutual funds or ETFs it costs NOTHING to hold individual securities. In fact I could purchase $100K of a Canadian bank for $6.95, and hold it indefinitely for nothing more. 

You also mention inflation rates, which will be eclipsed by returns from 'sound' investments. 

Finally, what is a TSIF?  I think you mean TFSA."

I don't think we will see an anti-gay agenda, though I do expect less support for the excesses of a hijacked quest for equality before the law.

Why fund the CBC if all it can do is mimic its private competitors? Which is pretty much what it has done (and then not all that well) for the past 20 years or more. The fact a succession of prime ministers including and particularly Harper drastically cut the CBC's budget helps explain but does nothing to justify its failing performance. 

When CBC replaces Mansbridge, maybe it could forego the American MSM nice voice/pretty face standard in favour of someone who can not only read the teleprompter while appearing trustworthy, but who actually understands history, facts and dynamics behind the news."

One example of a ""make magic happen"" guy whose name many will recognize, but you don't hear often, is Jonathan Ive, the Chief Design Officer (or something like that) at Apple.   He's the guy who designed (and envisioned, to be frank) the kind of interfaces for which Apple is best known.   Without him, I'm not sure Apple would still be a standalone company.   To his credit, Jobs recognized the talent that Ive has, supported it, and didn't mess with it.

And, in any event, by the time Bezos, Jobs, Gates and other ""Billionpreneurs"" became household names, they have already made billions in their firms' respective stocks and generally hold a LOT.   If the point of stock options is to align the CEO with shareholder interests, then stock options are unnecessary in these cases.   These guys are in it for the long term."
"Genius, people who buy cocaine and heroin by the ton have no trouble having their supplier throw a few cases of guns in the shipment.   You can buy a fully-automatic AK platform weapon in the ME, Africa, and much of South Asia and South America for a hundred bucks or less.  Brand name handguns are hard to get, but there are lots of serviceable copies out there.   There is relatively little flow of legally purchased weapons to criminals.   Most guns in the hands of criminals were illegally purchased by straw men, stolen, or smuggled.   Of course, not a few were put in the hands of criminals by the Obama Administration in their unbelievably stupid ""Fast and Furious"" gun-running operation.   No legitimate bad guy would be caught dead with a US legal semi-automatic weapon.   A US legal AK starts at about $800 and is semi-auto, the smuggled one is cheaper and is full-auto; crooks are generally stupid, but not that stupid."
"What is really quite ironic, and of course hypocritical, is the author's whining, slanted diatribe,  criticizing Fox for being biased, while ignoring the unprecedented  unprofessional, disgusting and fake news thrust upon any viewer on a daily basis, by the Clinton News Network, a.k.a. CNN.

"In past election cycles, the voters, have been led to believe the tax returns of all the candidates give us some great insight to the individual.. It would be a greater value for me to know simply how much they give to charity. Which is always one of the big talking points of a candidate.  The tax return of the first member of the Romney family to run for president were the first ones released during a campaign. It was a publicity stunt that saw little scrutiny by voters or the press. Today a candidates tax return is a blood sport. In reality have any of these tax returns ever actually undergo a conclusive investigation proving they are the full and complete final filings.  NO.

I've seen enough bogus tax returns to know it is not complicated to produce one with whatever you want it to say.  The IRS does not care what you put out to the public. It is only concerned with what you actuly submit to them. Ask your banker if they ever see false returns used to qualify for a loan."

"Absolutely. The employee contribution as a percentage of earnings (up to the maximum) was 1.8% from 1966 until 1987 when it increased to 1.9%.  From 1988 to 2003 there was a steady increase in the rate up to 4.95%.  The increase was the direct result of dire warnings that CPP would be insolvent within 20 years if the program wasn't changed.

Your employer or the self-employed of course double that contribution for the respective period.  Which is a cost ultimately borne by the employee in foregone pay increases.

Current government policy is to increase the contributions by another full 1% within the next 8 years.  

So we have gone from a program that cost employees 3.6% to one that currently costs almost 10% increasing to 12% in the near term."

As for religious tolerance one simply needs to look at the case of the Little Sisters of the Poor and their case against ACA in which their healthcare plan was forced to purchase contraception despite their religious beliefs. A case they won by the way. In that case they proved that they were not compelled to follow the same rules. 

I could also point to past lax enforcement of immigration as well, did those that enter the US illegally follow the established rules others used to legally enter?"
What an absolutely stupid comment. The supply of lawyers is also dictated by off shore schools. Seeing that only1 in 11 students get into a Canadian Law school when they apply what happens to the ten? Well maybe 2 or 3 give up the rest go off shore. Bond University in Australia has a complete Canadian Law school and the other kids go to the United States or Britain - then they come back and the Canadian Federation of Law Societies lets them take catch up courses and bingo they write the Bar and are lawyers. Seeing that 1/3 of the students that wrote the Bar in Ontario last year received their education off shore that means the law societies do control the amount of lawyers. Nice try though.

"I read your link.  As a mental health practitioner I think the article you cite fails to mention that in teenagers, the executive centers of the brain are not fully functional and won't be until the mid twenties.  The military seems to understand this on some intuitive level because they take teenagers and put them in infantry and other front line killing situations.  We can see this historically for millennia and recently with even younger children in the developing world.  We really need to understand that teenage brains are not yet adult brains and decisions we think teens should be capable of making aren't a given.

Meanwhile,  I suggest that at home we  teach resiliency, that things happen in life that don't require such reactivity,  as well as self protection , plus, discernment when dealing with others. Too many succumb to thinking the other guy is wrong, or represents what bothers them, in this climate. Grateful everyone is okay and for the police work."

"Alaska currently pays out more and takes less in from oil companies than any time in it's history.  Huge cuts in the oil production tax, not declining oil prices are responsible for the bulk of the deficit.  A fact that very few people understand. If the oil and gas industry paid its fair share the deficit would be 50-75% solved.  A modest progressive income tax would be all we need to fill the gap.  Protect the PFD.

It’s not at all clear that he has any idea what is/isn’t included in the deal and simply adopted that position as a way to attack President Obama. So when his advisors told him that it was working and failed to provide him with an excuse to abandon the agreement, apparently he had “a bit of a meltdown.”"

Lucroy is a definite yes...Chatwood would never return as he has been counting the days to escape Coors. Cargo needs to move on as they need to promote from within to keep the budget right to sign Blackmon. Neschek is a definite yes and McGee should be targeted especially if Holland moves on.

2.  ""The program adds more debt"". That is a falsehood, it merely advances in time the decisions of prospective purchasers to acquire a home. Does UBC School of Business not understand the time value of money? I.e. buy property now instead of next year when it has gone up more than 2.5% in value.

Speeding up traffic on Moanalua Road (H201) between Pearl City and Aiea during the afternoon rush hour - all the way to Kamehameha Highway with a light instead of a stop sign at the intersection of Kamehmeha and Moanalua would divert hundreds of vehicles from H-1.

"You clearly don't understand that some companies are legally set up to distribute a larger percentage of cashflow to the shareholder or unit holder rather primarily because they don't require significant capital inputs to generate future revenue.  As a result dividend increases are less frequent or even rare compared to your traditional blue chip dividend stock.

While some of the businesses and sectors come with inherently more risk in exchange for the higher payout, many come with only marginally elevated risk.  The trade off in the later is generally less capital growth.

Many companies that have their origins in the former trust sector are based on this model.

But it is indeed amusing to listen to trader shun dividend investments because they are too risky."

My assumption is there is some number you are looking for that will swing your vote one way or the other.

Maybe this thought can help.  It isn't how many total companies but how many WILL pass the tax on to the poor thru lower middle class.  The poor won't or can't buy I-pads (optional for the more well to do.) and things like that  But the poor have to buy gas, food, and insurance.  They also have to pay utility bills.  I'm sure PacifiCorp (electricity), Portland General Electric, NW Natural Gas, CenturyLink, and all cell phone providers, et al. will easily pass the minimum threshold for the tax to kick in.  My guess is most public utilities like EWEB and SUB will also hit the minimum threshold.  These companies will all easily pass the tax on.  Does this help?"

Non-violent dissent is a right in the US.

2) The US avoids violence when it can.  NK systematically uses violence against its own citizens and is currently threatening many countries around the world with annihilation because they have criticized NK.

3) The US basically observes international law.  NK regularly breaks international law, especially UN sanctions.

4) NK is based upon autarky. The US trades globally.

5) Military service is compulsory in NK and voluntary in the US.

6) NK leadership is based upon a divine cult of personality. US politicians are political pinatas.

7) NK believes that Koreans are the master race. The US severely punishes racists.

NK is an awful dictatorship run by a fascist, lunatic thug.

Look, birds LOVE me. People always ask me what I think about birds. I have the best birds. We look at the polls and I'm winning all the birds. Okay? And that's good, that's to be expected. But listen I love birds. I'm a friend of the birds, always we've been friends.

You know what birds I hate? Chinese birds. And Muslim birds. And Mexican birds. We're going to build a birdcage for all of those birds. It's going to be a beautiful birdcage. And I'm going to make the birds pay for it. The beauty of me, and this is important. It's great. I can talk like a bird. You know, squawk. I'm very good at squawking. The best.

And someone very smart, almost as smart as me, said it is better to live one day as a hawk than 100 years as a pigeon.

My point is that the Church does NOT teach that sex is ""bad.""  It is those who hate the Church that report that the Church teaches that sex is bad.  So the reason that millenials don't got to Church is because some non-Church secular entity told them something that is not true.  Pathetic."

"The flaw is that Mr. Browne's death preceded  not only the 2008 financial crisis but also the collapse in interest rates.  His portfolio theory was crafted and ""tested"" during a period of relatively high interest rates, primarily the 70s, 80s, and 90s.

A weighting of 50% in T-bills & long bonds admittedly might provide downside protection but at what cost?  

I don't disagree with the notion of a permanent portfolio as it speaks to developing a sound investment strategy and sticking with it rather than being driven by panic.   But I think one also needs to be rationale and adapt over time.  For example at one time it made a lot more sense to hold T-bills when they were paying 3 or 4% and upwards of 10 - 12%..  Today they aren't even worth the bother.  There is arguably a stronger case for long bonds, but as mine have matured over the last 10 years I have sought more lucrative options.  If rates normalize I will adapt again - but certainly not at 50% fixed income."

I think it was the opposite, they were paid to pop up. There was such a bad smell to it. They all came out 'as if on cue' right after the Billy Bush tape.

"The study that Dave seems to be referring to is the March 20 special report “TORONTO HOUSING: THE HEAT IS ON, BUYERS CAUGHT UP IN THE ACTION”, which was actually written by Beata Caranci and Katherine Judge as well as Diana Petramala. Dave writes: “prices have not been surging substantially above the market’s normal range of growth for very long – just 15 months, Ms. Petramala calculates.” The authors seem to think that housing prices in Toronto started accelerating unacceptably in Toronto in 2016 and after, although the annual inflation rate for housing prices in January 2016 was 8.6%, down from 9.5% in December 2015. (All rates are based on the Teranet National Bank HPI for Toronto.) One might note that July 2015 would seem to be a more natural marker. This was the first month since August 2012 that the housing price inflation rate exceeded 8.0%, at 8.4%. It has been at least that high ever since."

"Two points missing from your story are any mention of year to year spending cuts. When oil prices dropped, all of the oil companies reduced spending. Wouldn't it make sense for the state to at least reduce a few positions?

Also, what needs to be clarified is all of the different sources of oil revenue. I am by no means an expert, but the state is receiving revenue from production taxes, royalty oil (which they sell at a premium price, which makes the state as much money as possible, but also drives up the prices we pay at the pump), and corporate income taxes. Additionally, local governments collect property taxes. What really confuses matters is when the state further defines revenue as restricted or unrestricted. 

It's too bad the state drug their feet 10 years ago on gas line negotiations. Had they moved quickly, we could be selling gas this year. I'd suggest they all look in the mirror on that one."

It's clear to me that the citizens of Anchorage simply don't deserve Division 1 college hockey. It's a shame. Because Division 1 college hockey BUILT the rest of the hockey in this town. There were a couple of pioneers who got youth hockey going in this city but it didn't blossom until kids from all over Canada came to UAA to play hockey and decided to stay. The ADN's favorite and much ballyhooed Aces team simply wouldn't exist had former UAA players not started it. Aces succeed where UAA doesn't because college hockey isn't a game for drunken douche-bag fans who need an outlet for the misery they repress all week at their crappy jobs. D1 hockey is the last of the big college sports which is uncorrupted by the profit motive and apparently in Alaska that's enough to end you. Anchorage has the worst sports fans of any American city.

"The problem is they loan money for homes, then turn around and buy stocks, bonds and that money perpetuates a huge cash reserve for them.   If you go to there websites you have to check out their financial reports. They have done amazingly well making a bunch of money. They paid the state a measly 10 million dollar dividend on nearly 500 million in cash.  

As far as home loan assistance for those who need it, that's not a bad idea. But they also loan to folks who qualify at private banks.  On the other hand private business can go to a private bank with their pro forma and ask for a loan, not a state government quasi entity. We cannot afford this anymore. I'm not sure what the Director's make, but it's probably a lot more than Walker as they are outside that wage control.

"Commenter: To me, its not the food...we come to hang out.
Uh-oh. Corporate memo: hustle those hang-out folks along!

It IS about the food--and the coffee, too--not the quality, not even speed at which you get it, but simply putting it in your hand with as few bodies as is corporately possible. Which is why I suggest some Tim locations are chronically understaffed.  Admittedly, ""chronically understaffed"" is a subjective phrase.  Line-ups happen not because of increased demand but because many staff members do ""double-double"" duty on both drive thru AND in store customer service simultaneously.  As a former business owner, my perception is a little different from that of others, but I will tell you one thing: NOBODY likes to wait in line more than a couple of minutes.  

The corporate priority is clear: growing our restaurant footprint around the world...

What happens in at outlets in Vernon BC or Sidney Nova Scotia or hundreds of other locales is of little importance."

Dotard also said that building the wall that Mexico would pay for was going to be easy. How's that wall coming along?

"I would rather work with a Hillary supporter than a Trump supporter any day. Trump is a proven racist and misogynist.

Examples for the weak minded who forget too easily (or just don't care):

Misogynist = bragging about sexually assaulting women and then stating that this was only ""locker room banter"".

Please defend any of these statements if you can. However, first place yourself in a black person's or woman's shoes and ask yourself how you would feel if either of these examples happened to you. The irrational out there, will likely state that this is not a problem and would be OK or even proud that Trump would show some attention to them.

"The bottom line is that your vehicle is worth less after a claim.   Not the full amount but less than before.   This loss of value isn't covered.

It WILL affect your resale because many people will skip over vehicles with a large claim on Carproof - even if the damage was just cosmetic.   If they don't skip over the vehicle, then the claim will be used as leverage to get a better price.    As the seller, you can try to hold off, but in the end you are taking a risk that another buyer is out there who won't care about the claim.    If not, then you have to keep trying, or drop your price.

And the story about how a dealer sells a vehicle with a claim is a little unrealistic because the same dealer will lowball on buying the vehicle because of the claim - same as any other buyer.    They know the market, would NOT overpay so they have margin to play with.

Insurance companies will repair the damage, but you foot the bill for the loss of value."

I'm not curious in the least about why Catholics voted for Trump. I have no doubt at all that, as I stated earlier, they were actually voting against Clinton.

I'm not saying that Lee's belief in slavery was right, but it was a different time.  We see it now through a very different lens - the lens of time.  You must realize how people thought at the time is different than now.  You cannot go back and demonize someone based on the morals of today's world.  What did he do after the war?

After Robert E. Lee surrendered, the general was pardoned by Lincoln. Lee moved to Lexington, Virginia, where he became the president of Washington College. It is believed that he accepted this low-profile post, which paid only $1,500 a year, because he felt it unseemly to profit after such a bloody and divisive conflict. In 1865, Lee signed an amnesty oath, asking once again to become a citizen of the US.  He did so as an active encouragement for confederate soldiers to rejoin the US.  Such a horrible, evil man."

Is it possible that Trump isn't as stupid as his opponents would want to believe?

Trump's latest actions could possibly lure Russia's interests to the west; so that in case of a war between America and China, Russia will be too far out of position, and preoccupied enough, so that Russia won't side with China?

Listen to the bulk of rhetoric ... almost all directed at N. Korea being an existential threat to America.

"Part 1

Marginal rates are fairly straightforward as you pointed out. Reputable organizations have published very different estimates for 'EFFECTIVE' tax rates that corps. Pay. The most recent estimate comes from the World Bank and International Finance Commission, which put the U. S. EFFECTIVE rate for 2014 at 27.9 percent. That’s second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured.

In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a survey of 13 prior estimates of the United States’ effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011. All 13 studies pegged the U.S.’s rate as above average, but none had the U.S. rate first overall."

The Court emphasized that care must be taken not to evolve an Aboriginal right into a modern right that is different than the Aboriginal right.  

 The court was clear that a ""gathering right"" to berries based on pre-contact times would not, for example, ""evolve"" into a right to ""gather"" natural gas within the traditional territory. The surface gathering of copper from the Coppermine River in the Northwest Territories in pre-contact times would not, I think, support an ""Aboriginal right"" to exploit deep shaft diamond mining in the same territory."

The Left entirely blames Bush for the last recession. It is a wicked lie. Bush did not initiate the policies that led to the crash, the Clinton admin and the Fed did. It is true that the foolish, irresponsible credit rules were supported by Bush, a few Republicans, all Democrats and the Fed. The Fed is mostly responsible for the recession. It is their Keynesian lunacy of growing debt bubbles instead of considering the productivity part of the equation. Everyone of us can live some good times on borrowed money, until the bill comes due. The Lenders followed the stupid, irresponsible rules created by Washington.  Washington, all of Washington, not just Bush was responsible."

"Pace Governor Poloz, the Canadian housing bubble does have implications for the inflation target. Homeowners’ replacement cost made a bigger contribution to the April annual inflation rate than any other component except for gasoline. However, at 3.9%, down from 4.0% in April, it doesn’t seem to properly reflect the national surge in housing prices, even given these are lagged data, actually reflecting the difference in February and March inflation rates. The Teranet National Bank HPI had an inflation rate of 13.5% in March, up from 13.4% in February.  The other owned accommodation expenses inflation rate of 3.5%, down from 3.6% in March, while it looks impressive, also likely badly underestimates actual inflationary pressures. Poloz will never complain about this underestimation, because he doesn't want to raise interest rates and he wants to keep driving the loonie down."

After thinking about those issues, I came to the conclusion that Jesus would not have voted for Mr. Trump.  But as Sister suggests, I think many  of Trump's Christian supporters did not think hard enough about their vote. I found it interesting that in the post-election days Hillary Clinton found it natural to quote Scripture; I cannot imagine Mr. Trump doing that."

"""All our self serving idiots are in Alberta and there aren't enough of them.""

What an attitude. Oh, there are conservatives coast to coast to coast as seen during the Harper era. Alberta is very diverse now - we have people from across Canada and the world. When you smear Alberta, your smear may be against people from your own home province who came to Alberta for ""work"" and live well.

It is time to look at unions in Canada. Do certified professions like teachers, nurses and other public service professionals need unionism? No. The government can set a sliding wage scale and increased pay should just not equate with how many hours/years on the job but the QUALITY of the work - just like in the private sector. Occupations that don't require specialized education need unions to protect worker rights.

O'Leary points are spot on: we shouldn't be importing oil products from the Saudi regime. We need to balance industries and build pipelines to fund the social net that makes Canada tick!"

Buy a vowel, a majority of Americans were not impressed and didn't support his efforts against President Nixon.

He said they cussed at him, called him a homophobe and stormed out. He also doesn't do Halloween cakes (and a woman in one article was outraged she couldn't get a cake for her Halloween wedding) or sexually  suggestive cakes.

I'm reminded of my sister's eldest son, who has about a 150IQ and often shows behaviour that verges on sociopathy. I caught him once, doing the once over to see if adults were paying attention, and then intentionally trying to push his toddler sister down the stairs into the basement. I caught her by her diaper, teetering just at the top of the stairs.  I told her brother I saw him planning it, that I knew it was intentional, and gave him a couple of swats on the ass, over his clothes.

Of course there was a kerfuffle with my sister, but do I think I did the right thing? Absolutely. There's misbehaviour, and then there's malice, and that was malicious and could have killed her."

You see, stock market crashes are a normal part of investing, and some of us with long term mindsets know that in a year or two the stock market will be churning up again and most if not all the losses recouped.  Just because the market crashes people still have loans they are paying, they still have to heat and power their home, they still have cell phones and gas to put in their cars etc. etc. etc.  Life goes on, and so do profits at these great companies.

I use this example a lot but here goes again.  This fall the Bank of Montreal will celebrate their 200th year in business.  Yes, 1817 to now.  In 1829 they started making dividend payments, and have not missed one since.  188 years of consecutive dividend payments.  Through two world wars, and EVERY single crash you mentioned and more, they kept churning out cash to their shareholders.  Do you really think this will change?  ALL the Canadian banks have similar stories.

"Glad you brought this up Curtis:  a hidden subtext to most efforts to raise minimum wage rates is the fact that many union CBAs have negotiated wage rates that are tied to the minimum wage rate.   The union scale wage rates automatically adjust up in line with a formula set forth in the CBA whenever there is an increase in the minimum wage rate, and the union workers do not have to wait for the end of the CBA to renegotiate a wage increase in order to keep pace.
So, if you increase the minimum wage to $22 an hour over 4-5 years, you will be creating automatic pay increases in similar amounts on most union workers.  So, the economic impact on business is not limited to just those businesses who employ minimum wage workers.

Unions know this, and that's why they support politicians who push hikes in the minimum wage."

"Since Nigel doesn't specify who the republicans he personally knows and who have said that, nor what they mean by it - I will speculate for you..

In this article, we see the direct labor cost increases that will effect the state.

If you take what ""republicans in general"" mean by ""the cost is far higher"" - you would have to do a little more math. Since zero skill jobs like gas station attendants, bussers at your local restaurants, and graveyard shift inventory stockers at your local grocery store would all have a higher cost of labor - and these employees create no increase in sales, productivity or efficiency just by being paid more - there will be tens of thousands of small businesses who have to raise prices to pay for the higher cost of labor.

It's forced inflation.

It has an exponential effect in every sector.

Sure, some people are ""paid more"" short term - but it will ""cost more"" for everyone long term."

The President and Min of Defence and Police must specify where such deployments will occur plus other requirements of the Defence Act.
The SANDF may so deploy to the Cape Flats area but will do so based on an SAPS generated plan of operation with  CJOps operational inputs in respect of troop levels and possible tasks.
Those tasks would typically be assisting with cordons, protection of police road blocks and vehicle checkpoints plus combined patrols.  The police remain responsible for crime investigation."

"WOW! All one has to do to find this letter factual and agree with it is to completely ignore history .Take your misguided thinking on Reagan for example..we know for sure that we experience no gain in long-term tax revenue from increasing tax rates on those making more than $200,000 per year. Lower tax rates, particularly on labor and capital, lead to higher levels of employment and economic growth. 

The Reagan tax cuts reduced rates for all income classes, especially the low and middle income earner. Reducing the high marginal rates (up to 70% on high-income earners) causes little, if any, revenue loss, because of the large, positive supply-side effects.  by the time President Reagan left office, the economy was generating more tax revenue at a maximum 28% rate than many on the left forecast it to generate at a maximum 70% rate.
The Reagan tax-rate reductions did, in fact, pay for themselves — but it took about seven years."

"The CBC has been around for 82 years (1935) since Conservative PM RB Bennett launched CBC radio to connect this vast country in which many regions still had no radio service at all.   The case for a national broadcaster was obvious - in 1935.

In 1952, CBC TV was launched and was the only TV network until upstart CTV came along  about 1961.  The case for CBC TV was obvious - in 1952.

Then and now, the CBC as a government welfare recipient was fat, lazy and self indulgent compared with private broadcasters.  

I saw this in 1963 when I was in the cast of a musical at Dalhousie University and we did promo numbers on both networks.  On CTV it was live, one take, and 2 staffers, announcer and cameraman.  CBC taped our numbers twice with a staff of at least 6. 

Bernier is right - the CBC should be pared down to a news only network, saving taxpayer dollars and freeing up ad revenues for the beleaguered private outlets.

Let's not repeat the blatant bribing of the CBC as in 2015."

Versus Obama's $300 million per year.  Trudeau has, however, committed about $1.5 billion into coastal marine science.  Almost all of his new scientist and biologist positions in DFO are marine.   So, he seems disproportionately interested in saltwater at the expense of the Great Lakes.  

One could argue that our mayors should be concerned about complacency and lack of funding by Canada.  We have yielded our sovereignty on the Great Lakes to the USA.  

The Great Lakes are vital to millions of Canadians yet the Trudeau government is taking them for granted.  While Trump's cuts are regrettable and wrong (in my opinion), we are no better."

Doctors, nurses, hospitals, drug-makers, and health insurers are no more “servants” of the masses, or even of those in need of health care, than are businessmen, bankers, teachers, journalists, or truck drivers servants of those who need their services. If you want to pay for the services of health care providers, then pay them; if you can’t afford it, try to negotiate a discount, or pay by installments, or seek access to private charity; but you have no “right” to take from health care providers what they’re not willing to supply."

"Oh, to be sure! If you boil Robert E. Lee's life down to just the slavery issue, you can find very objectionable things by today's standards. Yet following the Civil War, Lee didn't continue the fight for slavery but accepted the new way of things. As southern Americans went, he was enlightened for his day.

The point is, regardless of the slavery issue, Robert E. Lee was a genuine American hero. He was highly regarded in both the north and the south. He didn't create the complex political and social issues of his day. But he did act bravely and reasonably during the worst upheaval in American history."

Trump's demand that Arab States take a stronger stance against terrorism just gave SA the excuse it needed to apply pressure against Qatar and try to get them to fall in line with their political agenda. Saudi Arabia's actions against Qatar are no more legitimate than the US/British led invasion of Iraq on the trumped up charges that they possessed weapons of mass destruction. It's all just smoke and mirrors."

"The utility of a short bed quad cab pickup truck is just slightly better than if you took a reciprocating saw to the rear roof of a standard SUV.    

If you're going to get a pickup - go big or go home - get one with a long bed (if you really need to seat 4).    More realistic: get one with an extended cab (vs a quad cab).    Then you have the best of both worlds - some inside storage space (with jump seats for short rides) and a fairly decent sized bed - without being longer than a standard parking space.

Oh, and make sure you know how to drive it.   My neighbourhood has far too many urban cowboys driving massive pickups.   They drive down the center of the streets because they don't trust themselves not to hit the parked cars and and compound this by parking like total beginners - turning a two lane residential street into a narrow laneway.

"Great article. I would only add that Canada's main shortcoming today is in the world of ideas, and its tepid intellectual performance and all-white cast in the social sciences and international relations.  This country has the most diverse and qualified citizenry but it hasn't managed to produce a commensurate body of knowledge on where the world is and where it is going. 

Question: Can we name one book on China's politics and economics that has been written in Canada over the pasr decade that has been read and quoted beyond this country's borders? How about a myriad of other countries that are in the news on a daily basis such as the U.S., Russia, Iran, etc. Canada's emergence from its role as a colony must begin with a more visible presence in the world of ideas."

But some hungry builders put forth the concept of 5% down !  So just after WW2 , when the housing demand was high and vets didn't have much cash, CMHC filled the gap.
But........ is 5%, or 0% down on a house reasonable and responsible ?
Canadians meet their responsibilities. So,the CMHC premiums , the cost, is too high, if, and only if the transaction makes sense.  
No, it's not a tax.   ""Old Stock"" Canadians tend toward higher down-payments ."

Whites receive 60% or more of Medicaid in 18 states.  So ""them"" isn't getting the ""welfare"", ""us"", meaning whites, is getting it.

Just consider how WikiLeaks tried its hardest to torpedo Hillary Clinton's campaign (allegedly because of personal animosity toward Clinton by Assange, from when she was Secretary of State). They received a stolen archive of emails from Russian government-backed hackers, and released them slowly over the course of the election campaign in an attempt to keep a steady flow of negative Hillary headlines in the news.

"Dictionary definition:  Militia 1.(a) org., any military force...
Either you are too ignorant or stupid to read the first dictionary definition.  The only ""Well-regulated Militia"" legally existing in the U.S. is those under the Department of Defense.

The current examples sitting in jail in Oregon.  A ""Well-regulated Militia"" has been in existence for most of the history of the nation without any need for civilian weaponry to defend it.

Some corners following a meandering tide line drawn by nature that make a mockery of the linear mythology of an exact 200 foot measurement.  The actual meander as authenticated by expensive tideland US recorded BLM surveys which it is illegal to obliterate.  So, ARRC owns to the point where the soil is tidally affected and gets wet.  You may have tidelands filled to the moon but they remain forever tidelands which were given to the people of the state of Alaska irrevocably in 1959 if one believes that.

Singapore has a highly structured top-down system with  tightly scripted control of curriculum and testing for all students from the central government.

Neither country touts ""school choice"". They have committed to, and invest appropriately, in a consistent and top notch universal education for ALL of their country's students.

"I'm sure Ibbitson has heard the Tories are choosing a new leader.  

And never did he say that the new leader must be a carbon copy of the former leader.

He simply presented his interesting analysis of what PM Harper might be thinking and whom he might be leaning towards in the choice of his successor.

And Ibbitson is right that the former PM will value highly the ability to unite the party and the country and the ability to be elected nationally.

I happen to agree that his possible preferences of O'Toole, Scheer and Bernier belong in the top tier.  And I would also add Raitt and Chong who would be better able to attract middle of the road voters and who have the most impressive back stories as the anti-Trudeaus who earned their credibility and successes themselves rather than inheriting them.

As for learning from their mistakes, I daresay that if they select a leader who returns them to power for a decade and provides outstanding leadership as Harper did, they'll be delighted."
"As the Minister of Information and Policy and Strategy advisor to the Hawaiian Kingdom I can state unequivocally and with full authority that the ""aquarium industry"" is in violation of one of the basic principles of Hawaiian culture, malama aina.

Malama aina has been a traditional socio-cultural practice of Hawaiians and ALL Polynesian peoples for many many thousands of years. Malama aina roughly translates as ""nurture and sustain what feeds and provides for us"". It means that we must act ethically, sustainably and on a subsistence basis at ALL times whenever we take food or resources from nature,

To do this we take from nature only what we need to sustain ourselves and NOTHING more and we do nothing that might effect the natural balance of all living things.

The ""aquarium industry"" violates this basic Hawaiian principle because it takes reef fish for monetary profit NOT for subsistence.

Similar to hard liquor though, the capability to distill (not make wine or beer) is easy for most people but it is still a federal crime to do it without proper licensing. Bootlegging laws have been on the books for quite some time and I have not seen a large effort to have it changed.

"No reflection against you, Mitchak, because I agree with you in principle.  Just a general rant - ""Now if only all people would be reasonable ...""

While the bridge was moved here, it's interesting to note that it was built just 11 years after our own O&C railroad reached Lane County.  Also interesting-- those railroad bridges that  still carry lumber from Coos Bay were built from 1912 to 1916, and one move-in was from  near Drain in 1907.  Hope they are still safe!

In time, the rabbi got old. The people now had to carry him to the town, where he would light a candle, tell a story, and say a prayer. And the crisis would pass.

After many years, the rabbi was too poor to light a candle and too forgetful to say the prayer. So he told the story and prepared to die. And the crisis passed.

The traditional moral of the tale is that the Lord loves a good story. The second moral of the tale is: none of us really knows if one of these days the Lord will use a very imperfect instrument to save us."

It regards no ideological extreme as taboo, no slippery demagogy as beyond the pale, no political dirty trick as beneath it, no internal corruption as reflecting on itself.  While the Trump debacle is certainly smashing up the whole rotting mess at the national level, it's best to remember that, owing to their redistricting coup of 2010, the Republicans are firmly in control of a considerable majority of state legislatures and governorships, and will suck up whatever outside money they need to keep those.  They can also be counted on to mug anybody, including fellow Republicans, if certain goodfellas dictate it.

Both terrorist acts based on religion of victims - that's religious terrorism.

Of course, Roof murdered 9 innocents in a church not because of their faith, but their race.  Purposeful terror based on race is no good, either.

The Planned Parenthood shooting was extremism based on faiths that demonize Planned Parenthood. Most mass shooters are unstable, but instability doesn't choose the target in a vacuum.

The Orlando shooter wasn't an Islamic extremist, he seems to have been a bisexual man tormented by that and his faith, which like many ""Christian"" groups, demonize homosexuality. So, unstable in part because of faith, but by what his faith did to him, not what he was supposedly doing for Allah."

""The framed copy of Time Magazine was hung up in at least four of President Trump’s golf clubs, from South Florida to Scotland. Filling the entire cover was a photo of Donald Trump.

“Donald Trump: The ‘Apprentice’ is a television smash!” the big headline said. Above the Time nameplate, there was another headline in all caps: “TRUMP IS HITTING ON ALL FRONTS . . . EVEN TV!”

""This cover — dated March 1, 2009 — looks like an impressive memento from Trump’s pre-presidential career. To club members eating lunch, or golfers waiting for a pro-shop purchase, it seemed to be a signal that Trump had always been a man who mattered. Even when he was just a reality-TV star, Trump was the kind of star who got a cover story in Time.

"""Trump is right, everyone that disagrees is wrong, so we should defend him at all costs.""   I've never heard any  conservatives defend Trump that way.  They point out liberal hypocrisy and so it may seem to  liberal ears  that  they are giving him ""blind"" support.  Whenever someone brings up the failure of Obamacare they are accused of all sorts of vile things by the liberal press and politicians. Lately with CNN's reputation in tatters they  have had to rely on lightweights, like Maddow and others to spread the propaganda.  But she falls short of CNN's gangsters when they had some semblance of  credibility."
"Trump will gain hugely if Britain's move results (after a few months turmoil) in increased employment and improvements in public safety.

Please do not rule out violence as speech should be free only so long as it agrees with the globalist agenda."
"The MSM seems to be neglecting and covering up the fact that FBI Director Comey is involved in a lawsuit for illegally monitoring Trump, american citizens, many members of the judiciary, including Antonin Scalia. Imagine that. The deep state is actively trying to take out Trump by using the NSA, CIA, and the FBI. Obama is also implicated in this lawsuit, surprize. This video is eye opening to say the least. I for one have always believed that this was going on and still say that Justice Roberts was blackmailed in order to get his ruling on Obamacare. I am not so sure that Justice Scalias death was from natural causes.

*How would you address, non Hawaiian and foreign, existing property and asset ownership and investment?

Khan was obviously telling Londoners not to be alarmed about the increased police presence they would see today. Fox News carried it, so I'm sure Trump heard the whole statement. He's simply a pathological liar."

Even he himself in  his recent (7/7)interview with CBC, did  admit to his teenager's frog in the well worldview. He had paid his dues for his errors, induced or otherwise, and the court system addressed Canada's due to him.   He does appears to be a very matured in his thinking.

There is rule of law in Canada and he correctly argued it through the court and the system arrived at a solution. It is unnecessary to harp on Canada. The system worked. One can be certain that in a repeat of a similar situation, Canada will likely to react no differently. A good society functions on rights and obligations; not rights alone."

"""The point is that Mr. Trump has done the morally indefensible.""

I fully agree with this statement.   That said, I believe Trump has not put a ""final nail"" in his own coffin.  As he has done since the start, he is talking around the media.   I've been spending time on Facebook reading comments that support Trump.   The common thread in their comments is Trump is speaking the truth about BLM and Antifa coming to the demonstration equally prepared for a fight.   His supporters ignore the moral difference and buy into the false equivalence between the radical left and right, they see BLM and Antifa as repugnant as the KKK.  

He is stating a fact that some parties on both sides were looking for a fight.  For the most part, the media is ignoring that small grain of truth.  Trump supporters position their arguments as a defense of the right to free speech and expression.

The cost to the Black population of this exclusion from the benefits of urbanization is incalculable, while the effects of the breakdown of family units can still be seen today.

Hasn't there been a pattern of depopulation in rural areas, where younger people pay prohibitive taxes to support elderly and jobless, then flee to the cities, leaving the remaining working young to pay even higher taxes, leading to a feedback cycle of workers leaving for the cities?

Of course the dude on the other side of the world did not know details on American export restrictions as proven by the emails to the manufacturer with his identity clearly exposed.  In response, a federal agency sent an agent half way around the world pretending to be a broker who would sell the parts to the dude if he came to the US to pick them up.  The dude does not see an obvious problem with this at worst assuming that export restrictions are just minor infractions as most people think about such things.  He comes to the US and is arrested and will now face years in US jails.  Meanwhile, his family and employees suffer.  There is no evidence in the story to suggest that the dude would have acted in any way after being told by the manufacturer that he could not buy the parts.  Wisdom?"

"I think the key to understanding AL is found in this sentence (on p. 27 in the online text): "" We have been called to form consciences, not to replace them.""  St.Paul admonished us to examine ourselves -- not each other -- lest we eat and drink unworthily.  The church forms consciences by reflecting on Scripture, Tradition and the lived experience of the church, but goes beyond its biblical mandate when attempting to impose a ""one-size fits all"" discipline.  Whether an individual person or couple is in a ""sinful relationship"" is a judgment made between them, their confessor and their God.  Francis is simply -- finally -- calling us to spiritual adulthood.

"My problem with seamless garment analogy is that it treats abortion like it really is a political issue.  It is not.  There is no abortion law and no agenda to expand personhood to the unborn, either in the second trimester or all the way to gastrulation (conception is bad science).  It is fraud to treat this as an issue when there is no set of actions to be taken that are not for show (like the whole Planned Parenthood thing) or vainglorious attempts to overturn a court decision that has at least seven justices on the Court who have already refused to do so.  It is a sham.  The main use is to get voters and donors riled up. Fraud."

Half the cops don't ever leave the police building and Denver cops rarely enforce traffic laws, registration and insurance requirements, etc. Hancock simply wants to waste public money and not accomplish anything, as he and the DPD refuse to take any responsibility or change police policies.

I actually think it's better to be cognizant of these issues and prepared.

There has been intensive research on marijuana consumption and brain development.   One early study appeared to have shown adolescents who smoked marijuana ended up with less IQ than non-consumers.  -  This was quickly debunked when it was found they had not controlled for socio-economic conditions.  -  It turns out the lower IQs were due to poverty, not very surprising.

But the idea stuck and even though all subsequent research has failed to find any proof of long-lasting harms for teens (or anyone else), people  continue to mislead with the idea, intentionally or not."

But I don’t agree with the author that the Reformation was a 'success’.  Before the Reformation there was actually room in the Catholic church for ‘Protestant’ views, at least milder ones.  No more.  Even in our days, the deliberate mistranslation in the canon  of ‘pro multis’ as ‘for all’ instead of ‘for many’ is an attempt, however unwitting, to exclude those who take a more Augustinian (Calvinistic?) view of soteriology."

It is well documented their wealth was nowhere near as obscene as it is today.

An average CEO would make 10-15X the average employee, it is now in the USA about 350x, but to you that is acceptable for these job creators.  I am astonished literally astonished at how naïve your comment is.   The economic system is not real it is a man made construct.  A construct that is more and more manipulated by the very few.

If they don't leave, eventually they'll all be killed. 

It's just the way it is there, it will never change. (I've been there)

The level of hatred for the Rohingya by the Buddhist majority is unbelievable.

But Burma's loss is Bangladesh's gain, becuase the Rohingya are amazingly good farmers, even with the crap land they're allowed to live on, but not ever own, in Burma.

Horgan is going to northwest B.C. on an ‘energy tour’? 

Somebody should remind Horgan where in B.C. the energy is actually located.  I’ll give you all a hint, it isn’t in northwest B.C.........

I suspect he has no intention of going to northeast B.C. because he is likely to be lynched. 

I remember during the election campaign during an interview with Keith Baldry, Horgan said something like this, “I’m going to create jobs, they just won’t be in Fort St. John.”

This isn’t the last time the NDP badmouthed Fort St. John, recently one of their members did it in the legislature. 

It is quite obvious that Horgan is only going to be a Premier for a select few in B.C., the rest have to fend for themselves.  And he certainly has no intention to travel to northeast B.C. because he has no interest in being Premier for that area of the province."

"What bunch of losers and idiots!  I clearly heard President Trump consistently state he does not support these racist groups or their points of view since the campaign last year.  Do these people think their down right stupid and worthless statements mean anything.  They are just adding to the chorus of the ANTIFA, Resistance and other sore losers that don't have a life or don't have jobs. How stupid has the Democratic Party become to fail to realize that throwing everything under the bus leaves them with no credibility?  Working class Americans, blue collar workers, unionized workers, middle class workers, Christians, minorities, legal aliens, legal immigrants and the myriad others that were the base of the Democratic Party are now shunned and vilified by the elected and appointed Democratic politicians.  Their shill creed is becoming the white noise on the 24/7 news cycle and quickly becoming irrelevant."
"Everything has changed in Canada, since the involvement of Natives. Forestry and mining has been hit hard. No one knows where this will lead to. Northern Ontario is vulnerable to these changes.

"Gerry Guay-
You are so far out to lunch on this issue it's not even funny.  First of all, since when does someone who is committed to doing something about climate change have to hang up any and all possible links to carbon emissions?  Maybe the mayor drives an electric car and does what he can when he can to reduce his own footprint.  If everyone did that it'd make a notable reduction in our country's CO2 output.  
You know how science has also shown how excessive fat and sugar are harmful for us?  Why don't you cut out ALL consumption of both, huh Gerry?  I guess you aren't that committed to health... See how dumb your original comment seems now?
The BEST business decision would have been to STAY in the Paris agreement.  That's why so many of our largest companies' CEOs came out against Trump's move to leave the agreement.  Maybe, Gerry, just maybe Trump is foolishly ignorant about most things and did this just to save face with his base.  60% of Americans disagree with him on this."

"Lots of wishful thinking here.  IMO, May lost her lead because of bad non-Brexit policy initiatives - the dementia tax - a far too cautious approach - refusing to show up to debates, and a complete inability to present a face that voters could warm up to.  If this had been about Brexit, the lib dems and SNP would have done better.

In the end I think this will come down to a choice of the Norwegian solution - ie EU membership costs and rules with no seat at the table plus a big exit bill - and hard Brexit - ie WTO rules and full sovereignty.  If I were the Brits I would go for the latter.  And I think they will.  

Brussels is entering these talks like they hold all the cards but when the spectre of  the UK leaving and taking their money with them comes clear - that unity will fall apart very quickly.

And as for the idea of focusing on something else, get real.  Article 50 has been invoked.  The clock is ticking.  There can be no focusing elsewhere."

"So let me get this right...the consequences we're talking about came to us as follows:

1. Obama wins two terms by the popular vote
2. Obama appoints a supreme court nominee (a compromise, someone towards the center that he hoped Republicans could get behind)
3. The Republicans in congress blocks the hearings from even taken place citing 'you can't appoint a justice during an election cycle'
4. Trump wins by the electoral college 
5. Trump appoints a supreme court nominee

These are the consequences of an election? They're actually three times removed from what the consequences of an election should be (the people pick the president and the president picks the supreme court nominee). This is pretty much the Republican party cutting in line and then looking back and saying ""We were here first"".

At least know how you got here before you start ignorantly parading on about 'consequences'."

The US civilian leadership chooses where and when to send the military and also selects their most senior leadership.  

Every General Officer or Admiral has to be nominated by the President of the United States and  confirmed by the US Senate each time he is promoted to a General Officer Rank, just like a Justice of the Supreme Court.

"Only the Congress can approve bankruptcy.   They usually defer to a State's decisions about which subordinate jurisdictions can go bankrupt.

Under current Oregon law, only certain water control districts are permitted to go bankrupt.

For the cities and counties to go bankrupt, first the State of Oregon would have to pass a law permitting it.

The SEIU 503 union, the Teachers' unions and all the other public service unions in the State would know that if that happened, all those union retirees, past and future, could lose their retirement money.

Do you think those unions are just going to roll over and say, ""Sure, take the money you agreed to pay me 30 years ago?""    Their lawsuits certainly don't indicate that attitude.

If the killer is a danger to others, he must be either killed or restrained.  Killing the killer should be done, however, not with glee and happiness, but with profound sadness for the man's failures."

"""Which only goes to support my point that the European immigration situation is not the same as Canada's...""

Hello?

Um, no, that sentiment was neither stated nor implied in your original post.

What your original post actually did was to praise what you called Canada's doing ""a much better job of integrating other cultures"", implying that the European governments were at fault for societal clashes there. Your post amounted to a claim that Canada was outperforming the European countries  in the area of integrating cultures.

You never commented on the nature of people arriving in Europe. I did. And what I pointed out was that no, it is actually the job of Canada's immigration screens that best explain our higher level of peaceful harmony, not the job of Canada's integration efforts as you claimed.

You are welcome to agree with my observation, as you apparently now do, but it is sophistry for you to pretend that my observation was somehow part and parcel of your original post."

I have been pointing this out for a long time here on the good old G and M - one of the reasons rich people come here is they know they can pay no income tax, while shamelessly using health care and other provincial and civic services.  Trudeau gutlessly refuses to have the CRA simply ENFORCE THE LAW.  We had a little furore a while ago about non-collection of capital gains tax and/or the property transfer tax.  Ideally those would be collected, too.   BUT the real money is in the fact that they don't report worldwide income, or even all their ""Canadian"" income.  So, let's kill dual citizenship, enforce tax laws in full, tax vacancies, maybe limit foreign buyers to new, or one unit only, and so on.  Quit handing out visas like candy.  Take immigrants based on skills only, not money.  Investigate deeply when a ""housewife"" with no taxable income buys a $3.5 M house.

Now, if the chances of terrorists' entering the country were small, or if the size of the harm they pose were small, there would be a good argument that NO special vetting is needed.  But no other population has, in recent times, had so many practitioners of both frequent and huge-scale violence.  So long as there are so many Muslims committing so many acts of terror in the name of Islam, we are rational in at least taking special care to see that those who come aren't a real risk."

"Trump's policy of encouraging 'growth'?

Encouraging growth by holding rallies where he preens for his adoring pawns is not policy.

He hasn't actually created any policy.  He's made a lot of promises, and most of them have been proven to be lies.

No, chris, your cheerleading only indicates you have no clue what growth was attained in the last administration or what specific policies account for that growth.

Trump, though not actually creating any policy yet, has been dismantling and destroying policy enacted by President Obama and just like with the health care fiasco, Trump is going to create more disasters of the same or worse proportion.

What is huge is the likelihood of your cheerleading being all for naught.  

And the people most likely to bear the brunt of Trump's disasters are old folks like you and me.

Trust tax rules have recently changed to become much less attractive from a tax perspective.  Sheer is a hypocrite on this one.  And, anyone can form such trusts on death.

As for the argument that almost all scientists agree with global warming and the ones questioning are wackos it's because all of the research funding goes to the global warmers and anyone who wants to question the validity of global warming gets no funding.

What I like about Trump is he was against Mid East wars, and judging by Syria he has followed through on his promise to reduce war in that region. He even got the CIA to stop supporting the 'moderate rebels'  - ie ISIS allies, if not in fact ISIS. 

But now that the people he can trust have been removed - with great help from the Charlottesville disaster - I'm expecting renewed push for war in the mid east. The war machine is just too powerful. Nevertheless, desiring to reduce war will always be morally superior position to worrying about transgenders being allowed into the military."

Will President Trump either produce them or admit there are no recordings of your conversations with Comey and the others?

As you point out, many through history believed their impact to be negligible, but that opinion is being researched, new data gathered and challenged. 


Our government is very much part of the polarized political debate on climate change, sadly, when opposition presents, it is dismissed often out of hand.

And he further stated that you cannot force people to change a religious core tenet overnight. He stated that conservative society needs to evolved at its own pace.

The lesson here is simply the progressives are forcing too much of their agenda, too quickly and are not inclusive of the conservative core of the society they live in.

Most populists have different degrees of conservative views in their core. These needs require respect that progressives have ignored and run roughshod over."

There is NO WAY - repeat, there is NO WAY - to get house prices that high without external money flooding in. It is an IMPOSSIBILITY for local wages to get house prices to 24 times, to 30 times, to 36 times the average annual local income.

"""I have no idea what to say in rational response to such an extreme (and I might add, insulting to at least half the nation) take on the election success of the president elect.""

Really, utilitas?   Trump didn't get the support of over half the nation.  He finished second in the popular vote, and over 100 million voters didn't vote out of either indifference or Republican voter suppression.  Considering that the president-elect is a lying, misogynist, racist ignoramus who is including neo-Nazis in his inner circle, perhaps those voters who voted for him deserve to be insulted."

""The United Nation’s former global warming czar has published a paper claiming humanity only has three years left to avert dangerous global warming and meet the goals of the Paris climate accord.

To do that, Christiana Figueres says governments and businesses need to pony up $1.3 trillion a year by 2020 earmarked for “climate action” to decarbonize the global economy. That’s on top of boosting green energy and phasing out fossil fuels, mostly coal.

“[S]hould emissions continue to rise beyond 2020, or even remain level, the temperature goals set in Paris become almost unattainable,” Figueres, the former head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, wrote in an article published in Nature. “The UN Sustainable Development Goals that were agreed in 2015 would also be at grave risk.”""

But in general, the Pope would be well served to steer clear of involvement in the detailed affairs of non-RC individuals.

All bureaucracy needs, in its old age, such cleansing as Luther provided the church, and I am with Max Weber in admiring bureaucracy, the only way that humans in large groups can get things done.
Not sure why Martin Luther fits here though. Is it that Garrison sees many standing before a Trump tribunal, asking the media to recant their harsh words and doubting articles? Certainly in Putinland, that is what is happening.

the first is that the numbers have to be done precisely. Right now, America gets it emissions numbers based on a number of different instruments. China's comes from what their gov claims. Total BS.

"Human beings don't do a good job of ""observing"" the universe either. Our senses and our minds are adapted to life at one and only one particular scale, and at only a small range of EM frequencies and sound wave frequencies, and at a very idiosyncratic experience of the passage of time (in spite of the sophistication of some of our highfalutin scientific equations, which in any case are not true ""knowledge,"" nor are they the common property of all human beings). Other kinds of animals are far superior to human beings at observing other aspects of the universe, which must remain quite beyond our comprehension and even our imagining.

All Leviticus states is who definitely will be priests, excluding no women, he tell us that all of Aaron sons will be priests.  Leviticus excludes anyone who is bleeding, or sickly or crippled in any way.  This is likely the reason women were not often, if ever, made priests, the law regarding Menses was strict, as blood can corrupt the sacrifice, so it would have been difficult for women, in many years, to act as priests.

Jesus ordained no priests & the apostles he called to be judges, not priests, per two Gospels.  The apostles had to be Israelite Men to fulfill the part & gentiles could not fulfill it, so none of our clergy are legitimately ordained if we go by this standard for ordination.   

Also, no one's blood can corrupt Holy Eucharist.  Jesus is not corruptible so menses issues are gone too."

Brexit was largely about immigration.

So, Trump was ""inaccurate"" in that he rounded up from just over $675k, didn't distinguish between McAuliffe's PAC an the Va Dem Party PAC controlled by McAuliffe, and didn't make clear that McCabe wasn't solely in charge of the Clinton investigation.

Trump's quote on using nuclear weapons.

“I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process. It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen, because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.”

But I wasn't thinking so much troops rolling across the border as a political integration. No need for armies when you can take over a country with the stroke of a pen. 

Trump is a hardline negotiator who isn't afraid to use whatever leverage he has at his disposal. What makes a CanUSA FTA so hard to negotiate is the unbiquitous integration of our supply chains. Not much room to maneuver. So why have a border at all?

The idea has been floated before and to a certain extent is already partially realized. Security between the Can US border is a lot less intensive than it is at any other border control point. 

The idea of us adopting the US dollar has been floated at least once in the past 15 years.

In one case (Masterpiece Bakery) it ruled that the baker was wrong for declining to decorate a cake with pro-gay decorations; in the other case (Azucar Bakery) it ruled that the baker was well within their rights to refuse to bake decorate a cake with anti-gay decorations. Both cases involve the supposed right of each baker to pick and choose what artistic messages they wanted their artistic talents to convey. The CCRD apparently decreed that one ""artistic refusal"" was fine while the other ""artistic refusal"" was wrong when both ""artistic refusals"" involved the same issue: Gays. The State cannot decree that one form of ""artistic integrity based on personal beliefs"" is wrong while another is fine/legal without being what it is: The Colorado Civil Rights Division Where Hypocrisy Rules.

"We 'went into' Afghanistan well before that.

In 1979, the U.S. government began supporting and training anti-Soviet militias and warlords in Afghanistan, utilizing the Pakistani military and intelligence services to “funnel in money and aid to groups and institutions that the US viewed as favorable

The United States subsidized and protected local entities to pursue its goals in Afghanistan.
 The localities associated themselves with the American military in support of their own goals, but were reluctant to align themselves with their respective central government because the latter could not protect them. 

In the case of Iraq, moreover, the central government actively sought to diminish the influence of Sunni tribes and regions. 


Contrary to its own interests and intentions, the US, by supporting local tribes and militias, that  intervention has made it more difficult for Afghanistan and Iraq to consolidate their own central governments."

Actually, they did care - they were mad as hell that UNESCO assumed they had the right to declare their private property as 'biosphere preserves'.
And then there is Venice, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Venice can't afford to repair its structures that have decayed due to pollution, because UNESCO insists they use original materials - which was marble mined in Croatia, which is far more expensive than Italian  marble that could be used.  The UNESCO bureaucrats won't back down on this, so Venice just continues to rot in place.

It's not just pretentious Americans - it's pretentious One World bureaucrats .. UNESCO may have been a good idea, but it's become a double-edged sword for many countries.  They like the 'Heritage' designations, they hate the bureaucracy."
"Regional trading blocs involving countries with very uneven economic clout make no sense. Trump and the U.S. can dictate NAFTA terms because the U.S. accounts for about 80 percent of the bloc's total economy. Even in the EU, where weaker economies struggle to compete with the German colossus - albeit the Euro also plays a role in making the situation even more lopsided - cracks are appearing in the trading bloc. We have to get back to basics in all of this and if international trade is to become fairer vest our efforts in an improved WTO regime. Countries that don't comply with WTO rules and standards should be ostracized until they're brought into line. Canada and Mexico can do little on their own, or even together, to overcome American arrogance and intransigence. We need the rest of the world involved in the effort."

"""...conservative imperialists and monarchists who control our national mythology...""

Strange comment in the early 21st century, Work Farce!  Nobody talks about ""Imperialists"" in Canada today. That belongs to the era of the empire ""on which the sun never sets.""  Gone by the mid-1950s.  ""Our national mythology""?  It could be argued--and has been--that since the time the sun actually DID set on Britain's empire, Canada doesn't even HAVE one.  

Monarchists?  Well, out of tradition, most likely politeness (which may be part of whatever qualifies as Canadian myth) or curiosity, thousands of us will line  the streets to see Prince William wave from the back seat of a car as it rolls through our cities--(his grandmother being too elderly to do the deed.)  Monarchists?  A spent force. Don't see kids keeping scrapbooks on the Royal Family as my young mother once did.

"Einstein on the creation of Israel,    ""I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. Apart from the practical considerations, my awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain – especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight without a Jewish state.""  

A great genius that foretold of the catastrophe to come.  It is too bad he turned down the offer to become the leader of Israel and instead was disgusted and referred to them as fascists."

Do any of you idiots out there that want the nfl banned. Think about all the players who all ways stand and the players who have served before. The ones that help their communities and other charities. Want the nfl banned for the few players kneeling. When is probably less than 1% of the nfl kneeling. But you idiots think justice is nfl getting banned and all the players being out the job. Just seem so selfish and greedy that some people want that. Fuck all the players that stand that have served and that help out alot. They should all be out the job for the few the many shall pay. But of course greed is the american way.

"What if the Bishop decided that a lay person was fully qualified and trained and met his requirements to be his delegated person to represent him in carrying out the Sacramental functions he delegated. And ordained him as his priest delegate to celebrate Mass and even confer Sacramental absolution in confession.

The only thing stopping a lay person from receiving the Sacrament of Holy Orders is our custom of restricting the Sacrament of Orders to people who first become 'clerics'.

It is our choice to preserve the custom of dividing Christians into those who are 'clerics' and calling everyone else 'lay' people. In the beginning, everyone was simply 'Christian' even if they served the Community in some office."

"Hello ElRey,

In no place in my post did I voice disagreement with the right to a trial within a reasonable period of time.

Go back and re-read my post. You are trying to argue with something I did not write.

What I stated was that it was foolish for the Supreme Court to have placed the timing demands, the way that it did, on OTHER BODIES, such as the LEGISLATURE, along the lines of roughly ""we demand that you fix this within 12 months, and if you don't, well the penalty will be that functionally we will set accused persons free"".

How ON EARTH is it REASONABLE to punish SOCIETY (drop cases against a swath of accused persons) for a failure of the LEGISLATURE to answer a strict demand of ""fix it by such and such date"" from the BENCH?

It is not reasonable. Punish the LEGISLATURE if it is not doing its job, as I outlined in the conclusion of my post. Do not punish us out in society.

Mess-up extraordinaire by the high court."
