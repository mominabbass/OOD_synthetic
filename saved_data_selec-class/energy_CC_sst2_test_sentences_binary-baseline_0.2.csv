"Republicans are discovering how difficult governing is after years of just saying ""no.""  The majority of them have been repeatedly voting to repeal obamacare like zombies without brains.  Their only coherent argument for repealing the health care law seemed to be that it was because they said they would for the past seven years.  Beyond that, they had no plan and still don't.  To make matters worse, their ignorant leader in the white house also didn't know anything about policy and the legislative process.  Sad!!!"

Make no mistake though, Mike is trying to drag this out and get as many big names involved (Metzger, Rogan, Cumia, McInness) so his truly awful self involved hate podcast will get numbers.  He claims he cares about these issues but it's definitely about only about his ego.  Just look at this Mancow wannabe and his dumb golf putter trying to look all hard. Super cringy."

She was an unfaithful sleeze. She made a vow and did not keep it. She couldn't keep her legs shut. She completely destroyed her hard working man because of her sexual addiction and welcomed a man other than her husband into her bed. Of course he lost it. He goes to work while she shares there marriage bed with a low life scumbag. Those kids belong with his family not hers. Who knows how sleazy that sister is. She is probably after the PFDs and probably is just as sleazy.
Wait for it... here comes da tweet with the words loser and low ratings.
"Waters has done NOTHING for her 'constituents'. She IS a master politician though, continually convincing the dumb and helpless that 'A vote for Maxine' will make their lives better. Those lives have never gotten better, and they wont be. She's convincing in her lies when she tells them that all of their lives are bad because of Whitie. Her race-baiting skills are amazing. 
PS. Her mansion is closer to $4,000,000, but you're right, it's not in her district. She's become too elitist (like all good liberals), to live with her voting masses..."
"oh, zinkie's FEELINGS are hurt because one of her favorite 'minorities' can'ta  live in fantasy world and BE SUPPORTED BY THE US TAXPAYERS!

So why do we need such useless deviants  in the military if they can't perform mission one???  But zinky wants to FEEL GOOD.  and zinkie felt so good using her gutter language in writing about President Trump.   Here's a suggestion for zinky: go find yourself another country that's living in a fantasy world of your preference."

Same as the Republican Party.  Both are built on racism and hatred.  You know this.
"The Republican Party is tripping over themselves trying to distance themselves from the Alt Right. It's all lip service. The Aryan Nation Party (GOP) pitched a hissy fit when the Obama administration tried to put white supremacist groups on the terrorists watch list. It is the their white trash president that for more than eight years demanded to see President Obama's birth certificate. It was their white trash congress that obstructed at every turn, even denying President Obama's Supreme Court nominee for nearly a year. It was because he was the first Black President. No the Republican / Aryan Nation Party owns this. No amount of lip service will suffice. It is time to call out the entire party. The entire Republican Party, every single Republican voter all the way up to the party heads, has the blood of this weekend on their hands."

"The increasing use of online education means that some of the smaller campuses are no longer needed. These campuses typically have very limited course choice, and thus stream students into programs that they may not want or the community may not need. Where programs need hands-on experience (auto mechanics, for instance) students will have to leave communities that can't support reasonable enrollment. That might require student aid to provide grants rather than loans to students in remote communities. It is still likely that there will be net savings and improved education quality."

Why does Knight give $ to both Democrats and Republicans?
"Proponents of government-funded programs almost always state that there is no “fat” to cut from their programs and in fact need more money.  However, as a taxpayer, I do not think spending $697,177 by the National Science Foundation (a federally funded organization) on a play about climate change as lean muscle – and I think most Americans would agree that if there is enough money to hand out grants like this, then their budgets can be reduced (or at least not further grown)."
Gold medal in idiocy. What an embarrassment.
"No, it's you who's been thoroughly discredited here. You either don't understand what you're looking at or purposely misrepresent it. Either way, you've been owned.

Typical hypocrisy from the social justice warriors, push junk science and mediocrity like womens studies, or LGBT studies or forced native lobby indoctrination.  There's a reason they hate math and science and focus on stupidity like this, they take the money from the kids that work hard and find employment, and hand them to idiots who choose to demand things from everyone else under the guise of 'equity', lets call it what it is, Communism and Totalitarianism.

"They're moving a lot of these people into the private seniors' housing sector without consideration of the impacts of this strategy. The private residences aren't being compensated for the additional burden of providing health care services in these settings. The whole thing reminds me of the deinstitutionalization of mental health care a few decades ago, where seriously ill people were dumped into communities without adequate supports being put in place to care for them. What happened? Predictably, we're seen increases in chronic homelessness as well as the incarceration of the mentally ill. That's worked out well, hasn't it?"
I wish the officers had been able to use force and knock a few of those homeless thugs in the face...

"Bye Felicia. Faried is not a starter in the current NBA. The current NBA is about floor spacing, passing, and perimeter shooting, 3 things he's terrible at doing. Faried is useless when more than 10 feet from the basket and is awful at defense. His weaknesses have been holding the Nuggets back at the PF position for the last few years (nobody noticed because the team was terrible). If Faried truly believes he's still a starter, it will be a rude awakening when he's traded and is only given 10-15 minutes a game by his new coach. He's an undersized ""energy guy"" aka a bench player to any decent team. His agent needs to explain the reality of his role in today's NBA."

So at one point one section of GS was making huge profits off the losses of another section. People did not know what to do? They benefitted from the bailout and became a more normal bank, regulated by the government and everything. So whatever happened in 1998 was pretty much wiped out in 2008."

How can they spend money on counselors when class sizes are so astronomical? I agree that mental health is important, and I'd love to see full-time counselors on staff at every school. Unlike the scoffers below (Calling Balderas names like a grade-school bully isn't advancing your argument), I understand that there are children who come to school with deep issues that make learning extremely difficult. It'd be nice if all parents did a good job, but many of them don't, and we still want their kids to be productive members of society. We're stuffing them in loud, overcrowded classrooms, and it's not helping them or their peers, and it's burning out the teachers. 4J knows class size is of huge importance to parents, but they continue to blame schools and ignore parents.

"""....taxi permit owners threatened to sue over the loss of value of their permits and warned the quality of service would decline as cabbies struggled to make ends meet....""
Quality of service?  From an Anchorage cab? Ha! I just took a cab home from the airport and the taxi was pretty dirty/smelly and the rear passenger door couldn't be opened from the inside (slightly scary as a woman, in my opinion), oh and he ran a red light (sigh).  However, my taxi driver was very nice and a great conversationalist, which I did appreciate. Any investment is a risk, if the value of the permit declines, its a risk taken as with any investment. I welcome more competition...I welcome UBER, which I hope will encourage our taxis to have clean/nice/safe vehicles. I shouldn't have to say a little  prayer before I get in an Anchorage cab, but I do. Every. Single. Time."

Anyone with a minimum of intelligence and personal dignity is offended by these cretins who make all Americans look backward and mentally deficient. 
It really depends on how you define ""everyday Americans"" and if you look at Hillary's platform, that is, the policies she has stated on record that she intends to pursue when she becomes president, I say, I don't care who someone said they think Hillary hates as long as she actually tries to implement the non-rich people-friendly policies she has crafted in her policy statements. 
Seriously, what's the option--voting for Republicans? These people are always saying how much they love average Americans while they stab them in the back supporting policies that favor only the rich. The policies favored by Republicans are a matter of public record."

Be it liberals or conservatives, we have to draw a line somewhere; this country has no place for Nazism, White Supremacy and racism. We just have to stand up against such bigotries.

They are over-paid anyway - why do we pay them hundreds of thousands while paying teachers, cops and firefighters fractions of that - and people who risk their lives every day at work can't protest and make a fraction of what these protesting jerks make for working part of a year.

The corruption in the Democrat party really knows no boundaries, and  is constantly pushing the envelope further and further to the left.  Sad and such an embarrassment to Hawaii.

The government of Canada has proven over and over again that there is no way they can stop a disaster from happening.  They are always in reaction mode.

Someone has to fix this mess, or it's off the rails in another year. Costs have tripled since its inception and it's not available as more pull out of the markets. At minimum, now that the ball is rolling, the demos will have to participate in the senate or explain why to their idiots back home that sent them.

"That the benefit would not be worth the cost is clear to any intelligent person, but we’re talking about a State that voted for Trump. Alaska is fast becoming the Appalachia of the north.  Seems Trump voters are eager to return Alaska to full colony status, where we are only good for supplying the rest of the United states - and other countries - with our resources, for which we get little to nothing. Then when Alaska has been sucked dry by outside interests, we’ll be left with the ugly, broken, empty shell.  And who’s helping to do this? Our very own senators, legislators and Mallot, both of whom expect to get rewarded handsomely.  
Of course, the very same morons who voted for Trump also voted for the Republicans Gand semi-blue idiots who voted for Mallot.  These Alaskans - if you can them that - have no pride or backbone. They are pigs at the trough of our destruction. For shame."

"One thing that I don't see in any press on this subject is the impact of a big minimum wage hike on the cost of child care.  Lots of child care workers earn a lot less than $13/hour.  I think all child care workers are undervalued and should earn far more than they do, but I don't know many families who can afford to pay significantly more for child care. Infant care in a center costs around $1200 a month now.  A big wage hike would push that cost up by hundreds of dollars a month, as the biggest expense most child care centers have is wages.  I think we'll see a lot of mothers pushed out of the labor force by the jump in child care costs.  Combine the loss of an income with generally higher costs for goods and services, and this minimum wage hike will hit middle class families hard.   I have yet to see Kotek or anyone else explain how families are going to manage the increased cost of child care, and I haven't seen anyone in the press ask them to."

What would Jerry Prevo think about that story? Exactly what I think about his....
The university could have attempted such a ban if they wanted to have one (though it would have failed in any legal test it faced).  The city touted using the money for all sorts of 'good health and wellness programs' for its residents including several areas right near the university.  Unsurprisingly the city also targeted the area around the University in its efforts to get the tax approved.   Basically the sales job amounted to you will get all these things and someone else will pay for them.  Now it turns out that those students that were so stoked to get all that free stuff that someone else would pay for... will be paying for all that free stuff elsewhere in the city.  The university makes up 25% of the total tax to be collected.  So rather than being the recipients of 'other peoples money' they are instead the 'other people' paying for all the projects elsewhere in the city.

The GDP of the USA under Obama has been less than 2% actually closer to 1.3%.

First I'll say I'm not opposed to the pipeline, but I am opposed to it's location right through the middle of the GVRD.  The current route puts many people in great danger, even though KM have altered over 50% of the route to improve it. When it was initially built over 60 years ago, that region wasn't very populated  and there was only the occasional oil tanker travelling through the harbour.
 My suggestion is why doesn't the pipeline stay on the south side of the Fraser River, then go on the flat delta land to the Roberts Bank docks?  I was very pleased when I was told by a KM person at an open house, they also felt that route was best, but they said it would be much more difficult than just expanding the current route. Even the premier of AB suggested that route a few years ago.
 So the pipeline will go in the wrong location because it is an easier procedure !

"These standardized test cost millions of dollars -- there are the test writers (often people who didn't like teaching, so now they design tests), the software engineers (who earn double the salary of most teachers), the graders (who are paid pennies to pour over free-response questions) and a lot of others who administer the production, market, train and make presentations on these tests.
I wonder how much could be saved if we did away with these bloated tests  OR  how much class sizes could  be reduced if this money went to hire more teachers?  
Tests that have been used for years are available with fewer hours required for their administration and are of better quality.  We're re-invented the wheel and put it on every student, everywhere, all the time."
Sorry that you voted for Lisa and she has disappointed you.  She'd been in office for several years before her latest election.  It was clear to me that she would  pretend to be independent as long as the election was on going and then return to Lisa-GOP lite and ALWAYS vote for the GOP agenda after the election.   If this surprised you then you were not paying attention to her previous behaviors.

I think the Greens are reading too much into this win.  Many people like me voted Green because of the extreme corporate bias of the Liberals and on the other hand the undue influence of big labour on the NDP.  Anyone not aligned with these camps goes unrepresented. Andrew Weaver promised he would look at each situation and use an evidence based approach in making decisions.  That should have translated into taking the most rational and progressive portions of any issue. Unfortunately after the election the big lobby groups in the environment and labour pulled out all the stops and we instead have an NDP/Green alliance.   The pundits are underestimating the numbers who voted for the Greens out of protest of the other parties and the promise to shine a light on the business of government.

"Important hours that should be dedicated to the far more important core subject areas are eroded by frivolous things like Treaty Education in Saskatchewan. Is the STEM push going to erode things further if students aren't required to put in more hours to ensure we don't sacrifice the fundamental basics?

The government mandated that there had to be outcomes and indicators taught around Treaty Education but never provided the hours needed so teachers are strained trying to find ways to incorporate the outcomes in other subject areas which primarily fall within the far more important core subjects.

Is it any wonder why Saskatchewan's 2015 OECD PISA results were the lowest in the country when testing skills and knowledge for Math, Reading, and Science.

I certainly put STEM ahead of Treaty Education as far as importance but the only solution I see is mandating students to more instructional hours to cover all this frivolous stuff to ensure the core subjects aren't eroded any further."

And yes there are plenty of Canadian tech workers who would probably meet 80% of Mr. Alaire's hiring criteria but they would also have to fork out more cash like you would do in a normal economy - i.e. where supply and demand of resources is not inelastic!  So you have people like Mr. Alaire and others blurting out their sob story where they can't find tech talent. 20 years ago when we didn't have so much immigration, you met maybe 70% of the hiring criteria and the rest you learned.  After the decades of massive immigration we now have corporations addicted to cheap foreign labour at the xpense of Canadians.
