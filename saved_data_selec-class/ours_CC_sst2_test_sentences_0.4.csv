"""Actually read the report i did, it is no where near what is mentioned in the report"": That's strange, because on the 2nd to last page of the presentation Dermot is pointing at it says a progressive income tax will cost 544 to 786 jobs per $100 million of income tax. So it looks like his math is right (with some rounding) when he says $300 million would result in a loss of 1,600 to 2,500 jobs.

""but that aside it says CUT's WILL COST MORE JOBS!"" ... that wasn't the point of this line of conversation, started when Michael Albertson seemed flummoxed by the idea that an income tax could possibly cost jobs. Apparently it does. 

Besides, if maximum  employment was the goal, everyone should be handed a government job, right ? Well, we can't afford that you say. So how and why should we afford the ones we have?"

"In past election cycles, the voters, have been led to believe the tax returns of all the candidates give us some great insight to the individual.. It would be a greater value for me to know simply how much they give to charity. Which is always one of the big talking points of a candidate.  The tax return of the first member of the Romney family to run for president were the first ones released during a campaign. It was a publicity stunt that saw little scrutiny by voters or the press. Today a candidates tax return is a blood sport. In reality have any of these tax returns ever actually undergo a conclusive investigation proving they are the full and complete final filings.  NO.

I've seen enough bogus tax returns to know it is not complicated to produce one with whatever you want it to say.  The IRS does not care what you put out to the public. It is only concerned with what you actuly submit to them. Ask your banker if they ever see false returns used to qualify for a loan."

I think the Greens are reading too much into this win.  Many people like me voted Green because of the extreme corporate bias of the Liberals and on the other hand the undue influence of big labour on the NDP.  Anyone not aligned with these camps goes unrepresented. Andrew Weaver promised he would look at each situation and use an evidence based approach in making decisions.  That should have translated into taking the most rational and progressive portions of any issue. Unfortunately after the election the big lobby groups in the environment and labour pulled out all the stops and we instead have an NDP/Green alliance.   The pundits are underestimating the numbers who voted for the Greens out of protest of the other parties and the promise to shine a light on the business of government.

In the statement, ""The one who will be a man is already one,"" can be easily inferred that the author, Tertullian is actually cracking a very serious pun on the word ""man,"" and also maybe displaying knowledge of potency and actuality, as he was well-familiar with Aristotle's writings.      Tertullian believed that the sould was unique to each person AND that it came into being with the coming to be of the body.  ""Who is that man,

The pun on man is also a forced conclusion, because it was certainly intended to be ironic.  How can a ""the one one who WILL BE a man already BE a man""?  By being a man in two real senses:  Obviously, a fetus is not what we ordinarily think of when we think ""man.""

My point is that the Church does NOT teach that sex is ""bad.""  It is those who hate the Church that report that the Church teaches that sex is bad.  So the reason that millenials don't got to Church is because some non-Church secular entity told them something that is not true.  Pathetic."

"The Greens didn't have to cut a deal with either party. They could have stayed at arms-length from both and used their clout selectively. Now they are joined at the hip to a party best known in BC for its ruinous economic policies. This flirtation with power may not turn out so well for them. And to be fair, time for Christy to move on. The voters deserve the Liberals to provide them with a more attractive option."
"I would like to know why the religion of ""peace"" promotes child predators? Muhammad even had interests in girls as young as 5 yet people worship him as a God.

I said that there likely was some personal connection between killer and victim.  You interpreted this to be sexual abuse and demanded that I report anything I know to the police and eventually, you emailed that police about my comment.  Your bullying was exceptional.  But this is not about you or me.  It is about acceptable procedure for state schools in dealing with citizens.  Time will tell what will happen.

It's unfortunate this mine on lands the feds gave to the state for development was stopped from going through the permit process by one EPA employee with a personal environmental agenda, Phil North.  (Unlike Hillary, Phil was smart enough after corrupting the permit process and destroying his emails to flee the United States before he could be charged with multiple felonies for destroying official federal records) Not sure if the mine would have made it through the permitting process but if it did, the $1 billion a year in royalties and taxes to the State would have preserved the full permanent fund dividend payment for all Alaskans and sent another $400 million to the treasury for medicaid, education, and payments to seniors.  Not to mention providing thousands of $100,000 a year jobs for locals with no jobs now."

So his attack was in no way a retaliation for the Iraq war.

"Here, from the Washington Post, is a great ""fake news"" story:

""The framed copy of Time Magazine was hung up in at least four of President Trump’s golf clubs, from South Florida to Scotland. Filling the entire cover was a photo of Donald Trump.

“Donald Trump: The ‘Apprentice’ is a television smash!” the big headline said. Above the Time nameplate, there was another headline in all caps: “TRUMP IS HITTING ON ALL FRONTS . . . EVEN TV!”

""This cover — dated March 1, 2009 — looks like an impressive memento from Trump’s pre-presidential career. To club members eating lunch, or golfers waiting for a pro-shop purchase, it seemed to be a signal that Trump had always been a man who mattered. Even when he was just a reality-TV star, Trump was the kind of star who got a cover story in Time.

""But that wasn’t true.

""The Time cover is a fake.

""There was no March 1, 2009, issue of Time Magazine. And there was no issue at all in 2009 that had Trump on the cover."""

Unfortunately this sort of lack of due diligence and rubber stamping seems to be all too common when it comes to city redevelopment. It would be interesting to see how many members of the Planning Commision live in the affected neighborhoods that they seek to dictate change over. If they can't even be bothered to tour the neighborhood( walking) what business do they have changing it? This is a prime example of why many do not trust the cities judgment on a host of issues."
"We certainly are creating some very new bedfellows with the new Administration.  Who would think that Kristoff would have any positive comments.

Know that, it should be no suprise that Kristoff would be defending Syrian citizens from the horrific treatment by their own leadership.

"Regional trading blocs involving countries with very uneven economic clout make no sense. Trump and the U.S. can dictate NAFTA terms because the U.S. accounts for about 80 percent of the bloc's total economy.

We have to get back to basics in all of this and if international trade is to become fairer vest our efforts in an improved WTO regime. Countries that don't comply with WTO rules and standards should be ostracized until they're brought into line. Canada and Mexico can do little on their own, or even together, to overcome American arrogance and intransigence. We need the rest of the world involved in the effort."
"From the Wall Street Journal: ""The two sides unveiled business deals they valued at more than $250 billion, but were not actual contracts"".

That’s second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured.

In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a survey of 13 prior estimates of the United States’ effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011. All 13 studies pegged the U.S.’s rate as above average, but none had the U.S. rate first overall."

Walmart pays its average employee close to minimum wage.  As a result, the beneficiaries of Walmart's recent Thanksgiving charity drive to feed the hungry included its own employees.  Maintaining the current minimum wage means that homelessness will increase, as there are homeless families whose adult members are working, but are not making enough to pay rent. On the other hand, Costco has proven that it's possible for big box stores to pay much more, as it pays its average employee $20 an hour.

If they don't leave, eventually they'll all be killed.

This isn’t the last time the NDP badmouthed Fort St. John, recently one of their members did it in the legislature. 

It is quite obvious that Horgan is only going to be a Premier for a select few in B.C., the rest have to fend for themselves.  And he certainly has no intention to travel to northeast B.C. because he has no interest in being Premier for that area of the province."

Same deal with Trudeau and Trump.    But Trump has clearly not acted in his country's best interests.

"Family Trusts are often testamentary trusts, bequeathed at death from tax-paid money.  There is no tax dodge here.  Instead of bequeathing money into the hands of minors and infants, a Trust is formed where ALL income each year must be distributed to beneficiaries by a responsible person - income remaining inside the trust is taxed at a the highest rate.  Trust tax rules have recently changed to become much less attractive from a tax perspective.  Sheer is a hypocrite on this one.  And, anyone can form such trusts on death.

Farmers and businesspeople who have large pools of capital captured in companies can do an estate freeze and transfer the newco to family members.  There are may ways to skin a cat.

"Then, 24 hours later, these teen boys abduct a man and take him to the same house! A 16-year-old girl was there at 4:00 in the morning. Troopers arrested Damien, Devin and Austin Barrett that afternoon, at the Jasper house. They had them in custody. Did law enforcement not make the connection to the shooting the day before? Damien had an outstanding warrant; Austin had been arrested for theft the week before. It's quite clear he violated release conditions, at the very least. Unbelievable. Obviously, none of them fear the police.

I wonder how much could be saved if we did away with these bloated tests  OR  how much class sizes could  be reduced if this money went to hire more teachers?

"As someone who was brought up in a religious family with two christian preachers, my life turned around for the better and I became a real productive member of society when I went to community college and gained job skills. You call me a loser but in fact you don't even know who you're talking to except someone who doesn't share your point of view. The problem with religious actions like this is people wasting all that energy and resources on something that is not even real! So that is why I say pathetic- someone trying but failing majorly to do any good. 
And bronze age zombie jew- welp, those are just facts. Except zombies aren't real! (Some might say ancient desert tribe with no knowledge of how reality works, rather than bronze age, but I don't think that's what you are really attempting to dispute.)

"Who is Bernstein that anyone should care what he says? Since when is a reporter a person we look to to evaluate our leaders? Wear Trump's shoes for week. Listen the insults and ignorance coming at him. Trump gets right in the gutter with the Left and they hate it. They want the gutter for themselves.

The Left entirely blames Bush for the last recession. It is a wicked lie. Bush did not initiate the policies that led to the crash, the Clinton admin and the Fed did. It is true that the foolish, irresponsible credit rules were supported by Bush, a few Republicans, all Democrats and the Fed. The Fed is mostly responsible for the recession. It is their Keynesian lunacy of growing debt bubbles instead of considering the productivity part of the equation. Everyone of us can live some good times on borrowed money, until the bill comes due. The Lenders followed the stupid, irresponsible rules created by Washington.  Washington, all of Washington, not just Bush was responsible."
"The CBC has been around for 82 years (1935) since Conservative PM RB Bennett launched CBC radio to connect this vast country in which many regions still had no radio service at all.   The case for a national broadcaster was obvious - in 1935.

In 1952, CBC TV was launched and was the only TV network until upstart CTV came along  about 1961.  The case for CBC TV was obvious - in 1952.

Then and now, the CBC as a government welfare recipient was fat, lazy and self indulgent compared with private broadcasters.  

I saw this in 1963 when I was in the cast of a musical at Dalhousie University and we did promo numbers on both networks.  On CTV it was live, one take, and 2 staffers, announcer and cameraman.  CBC taped our numbers twice with a staff of at least 6. 

Bernier is right - the CBC should be pared down to a news only network, saving taxpayer dollars and freeing up ad revenues for the beleaguered private outlets.

Let's not repeat the blatant bribing of the CBC as in 2015."

"""All our self serving idiots are in Alberta and there aren't enough of them.""

What an attitude. Oh, there are conservatives coast to coast to coast as seen during the Harper era. Alberta is very diverse now - we have people from across Canada and the world. When you smear Alberta, your smear may be against people from your own home province who came to Alberta for ""work"" and live well.

It is time to look at unions in Canada. Do certified professions like teachers, nurses and other public service professionals need unionism? No. The government can set a sliding wage scale and increased pay should just not equate with how many hours/years on the job but the QUALITY of the work - just like in the private sector. Occupations that don't require specialized education need unions to protect worker rights.

Presumably, this would include cabinet ministers and their assistants, who would be able to solicit funds from those doing business with the government - hitting up stakeholders for cash. This just moved the influence peddling into the shadows. Should there be any conflict of interest, the records may be easily hidden or, more likely, deleted.

"Tim Bradner's proposal here is one to really take a hard look at, one that may be the only way for ANWR oil production to make its way through the hurdles. ASRC is by the far the most able to get past the political and economic challenges out there, and by partnering with BSNC and Calista on exploration costs, ASRC would really help to make passage through the forest of roadblocks possible. Indeed we are a people that shares its wealth with those less fortunate and to continue our tradition of doing that is far better than other options. Thank you Tim Bradner for this well thought out analysis of the ANWR discussion."

Basic health care AND education should be a non-partisan issue and should be a priority for one of the richest countries on earth.  

So lets quit the squabbling and get on board with an all-encompassing plan to insure everyone. Lets reduce medical costs by eliminating multiple insurers and use the all inclusive number of participants to negotiate for reasonable prices on medical care and prescription drugs."

"Incidentally - after reading Zinke's article - I am even more concerned...

Obviously any education (vs. indoctrination) is about critical thinking.

"Trump is an ugly speaking man - no question.  Tabloid entertainment in US whether acting under the guise of news media, reality tv, or talk shows, has lend itself to electing such a man to be President.

What I still cannot believe is how the Globe editors and journalist are in such denial that they are complicit in the ugliness.  First, since they are all in terribly declining business models, inflaming the situation to get viewership has been an absolute focus. Second, they are consumed with the subject at the expense of focusing on real issues and potential solutions and the pros and cons of those choices and solutions. 

Doyle quoted ""The Truth"".  Here is the truth, the vast majority of us are discounting everything your saying since its just so one sided and never ending.

Trump's quote on using nuclear weapons.

“I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process.

People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen, because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.”

"yes, they're likely all one person with multiple accounts, in India or Saxonwold, always pop up simultaneously and always parrot the same racist, deflective drivel. They're like a bad Nigerian email scam."
"I am not a Trump hater like some people here, just bash him for the sake of bashing him. I want to give him a little time, observe his action before passing any judgements. So far, all I found is unpredictability and instability. Recently, he handles the North Korean issue badly. The most disappointing is his stance on the Charlottesville incident. Be it liberals or conservatives, we have to draw a line somewhere; this country has no place for Nazism, White Supremacy and racism. We just have to stand up against such bigotries. His 'two sides' talk is absolutely ridiculous. There are no two sides; Nazism and racism is outright wrong!"
"Well, I'm now sufficiently frightened!  This is the worse news I have ever heard! I don't live my life on social media and now I know why. Trust in anything is out the door. Can we even trust our friends? We need to wonder if bots are dividing this country to the point of war or if the 1%ers are ruling the world. One World Order? Is it here?  Damn. I guess we had better stick to our state. Burrow into Alaska and only talk to each other? Yikes! How can we tell a bot from a person? Perhaps Microsoft can come up with an identifier in it's nextgen computers. What can we do in the meantime?"

"Right. A racist, sexist, bigoted, adulterous liar of a president should be supported, and those who voted for him praised.

Previous conservative presidents at least gave lip service to their Christianity. Do you really see Trump doing even that?"
"""Trump is right, everyone that disagrees is wrong, so we should defend him at all costs.""   I've never heard any  conservatives defend Trump that way.  They point out liberal hypocrisy and so it may seem to  liberal ears  that  they are giving him ""blind"" support.  Whenever someone brings up the failure of Obamacare they are accused of all sorts of vile things by the liberal press and politicians. Lately with CNN's reputation in tatters they  have had to rely on lightweights, like Maddow and others to spread the propaganda.  But she falls short of CNN's gangsters when they had some semblance of  credibility."
No surprise here. McCain once again showing his globalist loyalties keeping alive the Obamacare fascist agenda.

"So now, Trump is threatening military action against Venezuela.  Sadly, Mr. Trump is a cowardly and boastful imbecile, who is threatening to send other peoples' children into war.  He's a pathetic moron.

His administration is a total failure.  With Trump at the top, success is impossible."
"That's right.  What we need is more politicians wearing Mao blouses who really care about the people like Hillary Clinton. We need the government to create more jobs.  How about a government worker for every house?! That way we can make sure that people are cutting their grass to the right length, shoveling their snow into the right areas, not making the neighborhoods ugly with unsanctioned RVs, and not drinking sodas that are too big.  It will be wonderful!"
"Alaska currently pays out more and takes less in from oil companies than any time in it's history.  Huge cuts in the oil production tax, not declining oil prices are responsible for the bulk of the deficit.  A fact that very few people understand. If the oil and gas industry paid its fair share the deficit would be 50-75% solved.  A modest progressive income tax would be all we need to fill the gap.  Protect the PFD.  As ownership state shareholders, it's the people's return on their investment that keeps us connected to our great land."
"Merkel and Thatcher are and were effective leaders, but if I follow you correctly, if a woman who’s Premier of Alberta is of a conservative bent, it’s okay if she’s in charge.

Because you help delay well regulated and clean N. American mining… so that the elites can dump massive toxins in developing nations without you bothering to find out that reality.  

Your privileged self can go home now feeling good.  Because ignorance is bliss.  And you are ignorant. 

In the real world, while you sip your latte, use your copper wired devices, and preach about the evils of Western mining… everyone and everything else in the world suffers daily pollution you can not comprehend. 

And in the end… much of those billions of tons of toxins dumped by China, etc… end up in US waters."

We live out West of JC, have many friends in Junction City and I've been involved in JC school and civil affairs for 45 years.

In sum, it looks like the City's through that ""rough patch.""    ........Just a little note to all you JC officials.....please don't ""screw up"" and make me look really stupid.  Thanks, Gary"
"Trump is just playing to his base. You know the deal.  Black celebrities can and admirably do bring racism to the public focus.

"Finally, the Corporate Media wake up to a real news event other than the nonsense of presidential debates and assinine dialogue.  The Native American community nationally is banding together in greater numbers than ever before to preserve the earth's environment, land and waters, from the onslaught of the Oil Monopoly.  From the Lummi Nation to the Algonquin Conferation to the Seminole Nation to the Southwest Tribes to the California remnants, the people put their lives on the line.  Suitably, it is all taking place on land where Custer began his death march to the Greasy Grass.  North Dakota is the most recent state whose government was overthrown by the Oil Monopoly aided by farmer/land owner greed joined with political bribery for another One Party state like Alaska.  Every decent human being within this nation should be providing support for these heroes and demand the justice system and elected officals end the Oil Monopoly tyranny against land and people."

"Fair question.  Students, in the process of acquiring an education, learn skills and coping strategies.  Many students with challenges will ultimately develop strategies to work efficiently, albeit differently than the norm.  Their work is not ""less than"",  just produced differently.   Student support is also about facilitating strategies and developing self-advocacy.  My point with the tech sector is that employers, by being open to unusual work practices, get the creative and excellent output they need, when they need it, though the process often looks very non-traditional, even chaotic.   

 I have no issue with the fact that certain work environments require specific skills.  Part of transitioning to the workforce is the fact that ALL students, regardless of ability, need to match their skill set with work.  My point is that by accommodating kids who learn differently we give them a better chance to develop skills that could prove valuable- we just need to step outside the box."

What the CONSTITUTION says is that the feds HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO OWN land outside a few very specific situations...that is, ports, forts, territories (and the west is no longer a territory) and 10 sq miles of DC. They do not have the authority to dictate to people how they can USE their own land...anymore than they can harass and intimidate people into selling them property as ""public lands"" which they then ban the public from using. Furthermore, any laws made to the contrary are UNCONSTITUTIONAL and therefore illegal."

For the most part you haven't passed anything.  I find it laughable that you idiots complained about Obama care for 7 years and yet couldn't come up with the votes to pass anything.  What jokes the republicans  have become.  

I realize the Donald will never show us his tax returns as then he will be shown to be the fraud he is.  But since he complained about Obama's birth certificate, I can complain about his tax returns.  I could be demanding to see his birth certificate to prove his father was not an Orangutan"

This so called clown did defeat the best strategy the Dems had to offer, and they're pretty tricky their own selves. He also conned almost half of America to vote for him. Is it possible that Trump isn't as stupid as his opponents would want to believe?

Trump's latest actions could possibly lure Russia's interests to the west; so that in case of a war between America and China, Russia will be too far out of position, and preoccupied enough, so that Russia won't side with China?

Listen to the bulk of rhetoric ... almost all directed at N. Korea being an existential threat to America.

Our government is clearing the field for battle, and their first move is to pull Russia away from China.

"To all of you idiots comparing Lee with Hitler, etc.  That's ridiculous.  Hitler was evil, killing non combatants and trying to wipe out a people.  I'm not saying that Lee's belief in slavery was right, but it was a different time.  We see it now through a very different lens - the lens of time.  You must realize how people thought at the time is different than now.  You cannot go back and demonize someone based on the morals of today's world.  What did he do after the war?

After Robert E. Lee surrendered, the general was pardoned by Lincoln. Lee moved to Lexington, Virginia, where he became the president of Washington College. It is believed that he accepted this low-profile post, which paid only $1,500 a year, because he felt it unseemly to profit after such a bloody and divisive conflict. In 1865, Lee signed an amnesty oath, asking once again to become a citizen of the US.  He did so as an active encouragement for confederate soldiers to rejoin the US.  Such a horrible, evil man."

Would I please send them the $67,000 back?  I took their cheque into the bank and we had a good laugh about it.  It was pinned to the bulletin board for a couple of years.

These scammers have patience and highly developed communication skills and printing capabilities (certified cheque looked perfect).

Do your homework and make sure the money is absolutely in the bank before you spend any of your own money.

"Congrats, you found a website that has 16 sort-of fake stories about Trump, many of which were Twitter-based and later corrected. That's 16 stories out of the 1,000,000,000,000 that have been written about Trump.

No one is forcing them to do drugs, over eat, and other self destructive behaviors. Globalization is not kind to the poorly educated white folks that elected Trump. He can't change that, even with Putin's help. The coal industry jobs are never coming back. Republicans have been doing everything they can to keep the poor in poverty, breathing and drinking pollution. They are still using the Southern Strategy to recruit white racists to the GOP. The GOP is just a white identity party these days. Poorly educated white folks are the only demographic dying younger. They are killing themselves. No one is trying to prevent them from voting. They vote against their self interest."

Whites receive 60% or more of Medicaid in 18 states.  So ""them"" isn't getting the ""welfare"", ""us"", meaning whites, is getting it.

As you point out, many through history believed their impact to be negligible, but that opinion is being researched, new data gathered and challenged. 


Our government is very much part of the polarized political debate on climate change, sadly, when opposition presents, it is dismissed often out of hand.

Examples for the weak minded who forget too easily (or just don't care):

Racist = pointing to one of the only black people at his rally and stating something along the lines of ""Here is my black guy""; asking the a black reporter if she knows the Black Caucus in DC and if she can set up a meeting between he and them.

Misogynist = bragging about sexually assaulting women and then stating that this was only ""locker room banter"".

Please defend any of these statements if you can. However, first place yourself in a black person's or woman's shoes and ask yourself how you would feel if either of these examples happened to you. The irrational out there, will likely state that this is not a problem and would be OK or even proud that Trump would show some attention to them.

"Trump's policy of encouraging 'growth'?

Encouraging growth by holding rallies where he preens for his adoring pawns is not policy.

He hasn't actually created any policy.  He's made a lot of promises, and most of them have been proven to be lies.

No, chris, your cheerleading only indicates you have no clue what growth was attained in the last administration or what specific policies account for that growth.

Trump, though not actually creating any policy yet, has been dismantling and destroying policy enacted by President Obama and just like with the health care fiasco, Trump is going to create more disasters of the same or worse proportion.

What is huge is the likelihood of your cheerleading being all for naught.  

And the people most likely to bear the brunt of Trump's disasters are old folks like you and me.

The difference between me and you is you're cheering for your own demise.

Trudeau gutlessly refuses to have the CRA simply ENFORCE THE LAW.  We had a little furore a while ago about non-collection of capital gains tax and/or the property transfer tax.  Ideally those would be collected, too.   BUT the real money is in the fact that they don't report worldwide income, or even all their ""Canadian"" income.  So, let's kill dual citizenship, enforce tax laws in full, tax vacancies, maybe limit foreign buyers to new, or one unit only, and so on.  Quit handing out visas like candy.  Take immigrants based on skills only, not money.  Investigate deeply when a ""housewife"" with no taxable income buys a $3.5 M house.

"The Republican Party is tripping over themselves trying to distance themselves from the Alt Right. It's all lip service.

It was their white trash congress that obstructed at every turn, even denying President Obama's Supreme Court nominee for nearly a year. It was because he was the first Black President.

The corruption in the Democrat party really knows no boundaries, and  is constantly pushing the envelope further and further to the left.  Sad and such an embarrassment to Hawaii.  Of course, Chin isn't from Hawaii, so if things get bad here, hey just go back to Seattle and all will be fine."

"Trudeau speaks in progressive riddles and broad idealist puffery void of anything that could be considered a coherent message. His lobbying description is equivalent to suggesting sex with a condom doesn't count, he's embarrassing himself - Trudeau is regressing further into hypocrisy and ignorance by pretending that subscribing to a higher ""progressive"" moral authority gives him carte blanche to do whatever he wants. Just look at the climate deal, how much will it cost the average taxpayer? Eye rolls and contempt from Trudeau and Butts - don't ask questions, it's 2016, sunny ways and all that..."

"""I have no idea what to say in rational response to such an extreme (and I might add, insulting to at least half the nation) take on the election success of the president elect.""

Really, utilitas?   Trump didn't get the support of over half the nation.  He finished second in the popular vote, and over 100 million voters didn't vote out of either indifference or Republican voter suppression.  Considering that the president-elect is a lying, misogynist, racist ignoramus who is including neo-Nazis in his inner circle, perhaps those voters who voted for him deserve to be insulted."

Bill Clinton was the only president of the US whose penis was described in court proceedings while he was in office,  possibly the only leader of any country. Really hard to fathom why Knox would have wanted to give this vicious, sexual predator and his rebarbative slut-shaming wife a third term in the White House.

Typical hypocrisy from the social justice warriors, push junk science and mediocrity like womens studies, or LGBT studies or forced native lobby indoctrination.  There's a reason they hate math and science and focus on stupidity like this, they take the money from the kids that work hard and find employment, and hand them to idiots who choose to demand things from everyone else under the guise of 'equity', lets call it what it is, Communism and Totalitarianism.

Even while Obama investigated and illegally surveilled some media members the bulk of these creeps still supported his criminal activities and utilization of government agencies to batter his political opponents.

He and his crew were the  worst criminals ever to occupy the W.H.  History will not be kind to Obama when the research and exposures are written.  He took advice from a known slumlord and crooked operator.

Second, his two day delay to condemn that group has to do with waiting for the facts to come out, and not because he supports them. The leftist media jumped the gun on several occasions, and many people paid the price for it with their jobs gone, but the fools never learn. Trump is an outsider, the establishment hates him -most Democrats and some Republicans because they liked their comfy business as usual positions to ruin our country."

I'm surprised at your naivete Joan in stating that no major news media devoted time to teaching.... the major news media is corporate owned and specialists in fake news.  Your election times are a circus for the world to behold and many many people in your country woke up to the fact that your 'major news media' did not do its job precisely because it is fake news.  It doesnt matter what corrupt puppet your voters want, it is a farce giving you all the illusion you have control.  (Don't worry - very similar in our country).

What an absolutely stupid comment. The supply of lawyers is also dictated by off shore schools. Seeing that only1 in 11 students get into a Canadian Law school when they apply what happens to the ten? Well maybe 2 or 3 give up the rest go off shore. Bond University in Australia has a complete Canadian Law school and the other kids go to the United States or Britain - then they come back and the Canadian Federation of Law Societies lets them take catch up courses and bingo they write the Bar and are lawyers. Seeing that 1/3 of the students that wrote the Bar in Ontario last year received their education off shore that means the law societies do control the amount of lawyers. Nice try though.

"Well, the Trumpster has laid bare his lies. Health care and immigration aren't as simple as the simpleton made out. Quelle surprise. Americans should have been educated by the experience of  the last republican president, the dot-eyed imbecile from Texas who became a war criminal.
  Just saying."
"..no disrespect intended, but Canada cannot take in more people than it already has! These (syrian) migrants, were flown into Canada (on our tax dollars), by Air Canada, and Armed Forces air craft, when these politicians know very well that Canada has high unemployment, and these newcomers would not find work! There are many jobs (going begging!) in Alberta and Saskatchewan (mostly retail and hospitality), and settling them in these provinces would help alleviate the labour shortage! But these people know very well that...""why work"", when they can get generous welfare benefits, free accommodation, free education, etc.! Go walk in downtown Toronto, where the city is bursting with a large increasing population, empty factories, low vacancy rates and very high rents! These people did not wish to emigrate to Turkey, Iran nor Saudi Arabia, as these countries didn't want them, so why should Canada (aka, we the dumb taxpayer), take them here?"
They are like energizer bunnies high on stupid. Running in circles tossing one ridiculous idea out after another. ATWOOD BLDG. Simple.

"He's dangerous, not because he's an idiot but because he doesn't have the best interests of the US at heart but his own self interest. He's also dangerous, because some of his supporters are armed, dangerous and willing to start a violent revolt if they don't win."

"Remember when trump disparaged the gold star military family? That happened. He also disparaged John McCain publicly for being captured in war. He doesn't care, stop fooling yourself."
"It's the same everywhere, not just the US. Yet Trump and his ilk expect the world to bow to them and give the rest of us the short end of the stick. His tariff talks will create trade wars and make everything very expensive in the US. Does he really think no one will stand up to these threats? He's all about him and how no one else in the entire world is of the same caliber or worth (and I don't mean $$$-wise). Me, me,me, I,I,I. The man is a narcissistic mental midget who is mentally unstable on multiple levels."
"Considering Trump lies 60% of the time, the news must be real until proven otherwise.  The man is a serial liar and a con artist.  He preys on the weak minded."
"Read my comment before putting your massive foot in your tiny mouth. We're talking about deficit forecasts. And have you noticed that the monthly Federal deficits have gradually been creeping up.  now they're at 3.3 billion for a single month. If you have the slightest idea how a federal government constructs its finances you would grasp that it is the trend that kills.  Your pal Trudeau campaigned on the basis of 10 billion dollar deficits for a few years... The finance department itself has said we will see deficit till 2050. Canadian banks are forecasting deficits 35 to 40 billion dollars and we're now well on the way to achieving them.

Now, could you tell us where exactly is all that infrastructure that Trudeau promised? Projects aren't even on the drawing board and he's already spewing cash off the back of the truck. Liberal  bag of fools"

"Wrong... what is malignant is the media.  What the media is doing is taking sides against half the country who believe what Trump is doing is the right thing and it is bias schmucks like you in the media that are part of the problem not part of the cure.  

In fact for decades now you have declared war against the average working man/woman because you think YOU are enlightened and that the citizenry are too stupid to manage their our own lives... that YOU and big brother govt knows best.   

So thanks but no thanks asking for our help in destroying Trump... we plan on destroying the scum in the media instead."
I agree 100%. There's no reason whatsoever that a U.S. official should be allowed to do anything more than deny entry to their country.  We all know how the U.S. tends to go beyond what is reasonable-they are thugs in the first degree. The Harper government went overboard with this idea that U.S. officials should be armed on our soil and b) and c) ..Selling out sovereignty so a few trucks go across more quickly. Disgusting.
the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd .
As is the persistent posting of the same ridiculous comment.
Liberals like Dallaire and Junior  are far beyond simple common sense and are lost in a world of dumbed down stupid  pro terrorist liberalism.
"The real reason that Trump-lite Conservatives want to destroy public education is to generate even more dumb supporters.

Please stop the World, I want to get off."
Just when one thinks that Trump has run out of silly and/or abusive remarks he opens his mouth again.
The PC atmosphere in this country is getting us killed. It's time to stop this pathetic nonsense.

"Allegation = A claim or assertion that someone has done something illegal or wrong, typically one made without proof.  The headline reads ""allegations"".  Even if they are guilty you need to prove it in court.  Talk about a lynch mob.  Why not just skip the trial.   All those that had Kenoi convicted before trial raise your hands.  That's right, easy to talk crap but difficult to prove in a court of law.

Just like 2 months before the election poles and people said Trump has no chance. But people can't stand how racist the dems have become and how much cheating they do. Just last week we found out the only state Hilary won was California and we found out she got a few million votes from dead people. Thats how pathetic the dems have become."

"This is fantastically wrong.  Why on Earth do you think that BLM doesn't mind black on black crime?  Thats just silly on its face.  The movement was created about racial inequality in police shootings.  You think they are a joke because they are too narrowly focused? Also, the arrogance you have to assume that you have the solution to crime in black communities is astounding.  You listen to one episode of Rush and suddenly you are an expert?"
The government of Canada has proven over and over again that there is no way they can stop a disaster from happening.  They are always in reaction mode.  So when a spill happens on the coast it will not be cleaned up as this government tries to tell people it will.  They are lying the same way when they tell you they can prevent terrorist attacks - they cannot.

I'm not shooting anyone so why make such a ridiculous declaration. That's an emotional negative in itself. Everytime there is a shooting and especially a mass shooting you are asking those shot to give up their lives and their freedoms to please you. So give it some thought in how we can better solve the problems where no one loses their freedoms.

Immigration can only maintain the confidence of the populace if you properly extreme vet and only allow in people who make the country better.   The absolute test must be ""does this persons presence make Canada (or other jurisdiction) a better place than it is without them""?

Unfortunately the answer is often a no ... and we let them in anyways ... and then act surprised when they slaughter our citizenry or abuse our social safety nets or spread their religious hatred to others.

"trump is scary stupid, scary ignorant, scary uneducated and scary crude.  he must really be a very insecure man... like hitler.  churchhill had his eye on hitler and the natzi party for a long time. he knew that the natzi's plan to take down england would be a goal of germany.  he really worked FDR to join and send relief.  england was broke.  the american people weren't so aware of hitler, but FDR was....an anti german move would be hard to sell as there were so many GERMAN IMMIGRANTS (how dare them emigrate here!) in the states.  how many of you all have german blood in your ethnicity?  i have some. i'm the descendant of a dirty german  immigrant! and a scottish one, and an irish one, and an english one and a danish one and some indian blood from a canadian tribe.  wonder what the donald's lineage is?"

"You think the economic problems are because oil producers over extending themselves thanks to near 0% interest rates,, ???? are you really that stupid!! yes obviously, blaming the oil crash and economy issues on interest rates here? god what an idiot,  the world oil prices crashed, are very slowly coming back but notley and justin are doing the damnest to keep it down with all the new taxes etc too.."

"PS, I feel kinda bad for you.  All the Hate is coming from you and your fellow hate monger democraptics.  (sp intentional)  You people have called  Trump everything in the book.  You are tone deaf to your own party spewing hate. Did you notice the big COLLUSION theory you all have spouting was just more BS.   Months and months of ""He's colluding with Russia"", but no, just more Democraptic nonsense.  I can only wonder why Trump doesn't hit back harder."
"Lots of republicans on suicide watch today. The republican party as they knew it is no more.

"I find it interesting that most of your own comments are in and of themselves  ""ill minded comments"" and constitute attacks on people.  The arrogance in this statement, for example: ""I find it interesting that you don't acknowledge the faults in your thought process, especially once you've been called out on them"" followed immediately by the hypocritical statement: "" I don't attack anyone""  then, ""Think about it or at least try to think about it."" You clearly attack others.  You're also a grade A+ asshole."
Yes he has been in office for almost 100 days and what the hell has he done except use tax payer dollars to go on trips to Florida to play golf.  He makes Obama look like a tightwad.   And what exactly do you want to Donald to get done?   Lob more bombs into countries halfway around the world?  Build a stupiod wall?  Transform America into Orwell's Oceania?  This phony is so out of his league it is pathetic.
"Just shoot me now. This is so NOT what Canada needs: it's own version of a failed businessman turned reality TV ""star"" who is an obnoxious, pompous, self-absorbed, bombastic, egotistical, professed know it all. Like Trump, he is a charlatan and a fake. If we end up electing a mini-Trump like O'Leary, I don't know where I will move to.... Scandinavia?"
"It's interesting that the RG doesn't see the connection between this and the alt left mob protests in Eugene. These McCarthyist fueled ""movement"" is, at its heart, a neo Nazi movement and anti-semitism is a part of that. You cannot both accept these terrorists and condemn anti-semitism at the same time. These are NOT liberals. They are intolerant radical thugs."
"Got any proof to back up your nonsense allegations, such as say when they were charged for insider trading. Your Harper infatuation is pathetic."

"The demo's started this fiasco and tried to dump it on the other party when it went off all the cliffs. It's dying a slow death and in order to save it some painful decisions are needed.. well, the dems sure as hell don't want to do that and haven't. They talk the good talk but certainly don't walk it. Someone has to fix this mess, or it's off the rails in another year. Costs have tripled since its inception and it's not available as more pull out of the markets. At minimum, now that the ball is rolling, the demos will have to participate in the senate or explain why to their idiots back home that sent them. Re pubs will need to to work across that divide too.  It's not about Young, focus on the real problem."
"Ummm....yeah.
Make up your own history much.
You are a liar."
"really, this old fool has never said one nice thing about a republican that I can remember"

The only thing malignant is that tumor you call a brain that makes you so stupid.
"Time for Canada to turn it's back on the corrupt Liberals.  There should be ""NO CASH FOR ACCESS"".  Kathleen is doing it and now Junior is doing it.

How do people think that if I give a politician money to go to one of his dinners that he won't bend any rules for me.  This is absolutely insane for us to allow any form of this.

For Trudeau to say that influence will not happen for cash means he believes Canadians are stupid.  Are we really that stupid?  I hope not."
"I don't back ISIS, rather it is republicans who back them.  GW by igniting the middle east with his never ending wars, showed that.  He played right into their hands.  How dumb was that?  Doing it while reducing taxes was even stupider."
Buffet is scum....how do you think he got so rich?  And why do you think he supported Hillary?
"""What you need to know?"" There will be nothing new from Trump; it will just be the same bunch of lies and constant move to increase the swamp and make himself and his cronies wealthier at the expense of the American people. I can't believe that Americans have been this stupid."
There are no Democrats in North Dakota.  It's one of Donald's safe places.
Perhaps some people on this page should enter politics...  seems fitting since the ignorance and blatant stupidity of comments would certainly guarantee a seat in provincial politics....
They're definitely in a pattern of doubling down on the stupidity.
Smacks of fascism. How can a government deploy its police to bully citizens on behalf of corporate interests? You don't like our offer so we're going to send goons to beat you into submission? This is what the mafia does.
Finally something we can ALL agree on--Mr. Lines meets everyones' definition  of a scumbag.
Scumbag racist
"This man sounds insane, totally lost it, classic case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. What could he possibly be thinking of to make such outrageous and ridiculous claims about the president? Does he have no clue as to how he looks and sounds when he is saying such patently false things? Does he think the American people are so stupid as to believe anything he is saying? Buy a vowel, a majority of Americans were not impressed and didn't support his efforts against President Nixon. Hounding a legitimately elected president out of office is nothing to be proud of, Carl Bernstein has not improved with age. He is still the same arrogant a-hole he has always been in the past."
"Chrisin, that was a truly a idiotic rambling of nothing. You are correct this is not a left leaning country, Hillary is. What are you upset about??? I bet you are just ranting against the white man..."
Not to mention the fact that Comrey will be testifying and the investigation into Trump/ Russia is getting serious.
Must be confusing it with the other up and comer Covfefe. Moron.
"Politicians today are liars, cheats and
useless tools. We need to step back to a

2019 trudeau has to go."
"Only idiots believed collusion anyway. Hey, how about those emails that showed the media colluded with Hillary to defeat Bernie? That is an actual scandal....WHERE ARE YOU ON THAT Chris?"
"Take a look at the waistline of Alberta's ""fat cow"" health minister. By the way I am one of her ""sewer rats"". 
My previous comment of a simmilat nature was removed which means it is okay to call people ""sewer rats"" if you are a socialist politician but not to call politicians ""fat cows"" if you are a conservative - the hypocrisy stinks G&M."
No $shit Sherlock I am biased! Trump is a total disaster!
"Well, the OP singled out one religion, and claimed that students wanted a mosque in school, which is complete nonsense.  

If the OP has an issue with the law, then it should only be changed when it is applied uniformly to all religions.  When Catholic schools are shut down and no one is allowed to pray or celebrate religious holidays in public schools, then the prayer room should also be eliminated.  Until then, it's quite hypocritical to say that Muslims shouldn't be allowed to pray for an hour a week when we have entire taxpayer funded schools dedicated to sects of Christianity."
"Used to always watch them at Sparkey's after work before they hit it big, those were good times.  So glad you beat the hell out of your addiction Kelly Boy!"

Trump will have the rest of the world against him in everything if he persists in his stupidity.
"As happy as you may have been to leave I assure you that many of us were positively delighted. From the insane and embarrassing effort to portray Moochelle as the most beautiful and glamorous woman in the history of the world to the hero-worship of her dim-witted husband, we were trapped in an 8 year nightmare. I hope I never have to see your angry, bitter face again. Get over yourself."
you 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
What a buffoon Trump is! Should he not have screened his Justice Secretary particularly well? I'm not a fan of Sessions and his racist past but he had no choice but to recuse himself when his contacts with the Russians were revealed.
"Honolulu Hawaii, just another Democratic cesspool of cronyism and corruption !!!"
I thought that Bannon was scary but it turns out he is a moron.  The bishops should send him a fruit basket for making them look good.  It is the first time in ages that they have gotten good publicity from the press and lots of kudos from the public.
"""Evil"" is a most appropriate word for  Trump.
He brags that doesn't read books, and shuns reports. He  does not need to because, he ""just knows.""
That is called omniscience. It is associated with Gods.
In this case, an evil orange God."
"Good riddance scum...
Great Job Cheif Jewkes and staff."
"While it's true that all media make mistakes, it's foolish to brand all of them as the enemy.  Yes, one should also keep the bullshit monitor turned on, should always be skeptical, but effectively putting Breitbart and its ilk in the same class as NYT, NBC, WaPo, CBC, etc. is just stupidly self-defeating."
"Did I not quote the unscripted PM Gomer from the 2013 Mansbridge transcipts in the context of the Boston Marathon bombings?
 
Further, on those poor misunderstood Boston Marathon terrorists: ""During questioning, Dzhokhar alleged that he and his brother were motivated by extremist Islamist beliefs.""

So yes, there is at least one Canadian fool who sees ""terrorists, of the Islamic or far right variety (extremists of any kind), as poor and misunderstood."" So Thomas, are you also part of that group of fools?"
Is HiLIARy so dumb she does not realize the reason she lost was her?
"We need to remember.... the right smart liberals told us dumb electorate this already .... this is all far to complicated for us to possibly understand, so they won't bother trying to explain it to us dummies.  Just accept their word, 'cause they are good for it. Right? 

Unbelievable."
"Your an a-hole, how about a ceiling over bombardier?  I mean how many different entities taking it to court for illegal pampering does it take for a French Trudeau to finally say no more money.  And how about that pollution from all of the manufacturing in the region?  You know, of all the cars, trucks, ski-doos/sleds, airplanes, etc. being built that all burn that nasty oil?I am so sick of hypocrites like you, Codierre and Trudeau."
Joshua Boyle brings a new meaning to the words irresponsible and stupid. Incredible  stupidity in all this story is his and only his.
"Sure Lazee. Continue to rationalize your support of an idiotic demagogue with paper-thin excuses about ""dumping a lifelong politician"". Intelligent observers saw the differences between Clinton and Trump quite clearly with Clinton being a competent establishment candidate with clearly defined policy initiatives, and Trump being a thin-skinned megalomaniac in far over his head with aggressively bad policy proposals, where he bothered to come up with any, that is. Of course, no one has accused you of being an intelligent observer, have they?"
Moose too - damned moose and squirrel!
"It provably too late now, however, if you CI clergies & religious all speak up with 'Christ-like integrity' against clergy sex abuses of children, this problem will end in no time!
Yet you unethical, pompous attitude of believe in religious superiority as a clergies/religious decide to support the rapes of children by your silence till your soul will 'burn in hell'.
You clergies/religious do not believe there is a living God who is immanent in children, do you?
You don't believe in Holy Mary who is the mother of all souls on earth, do you? 
If you do not believe in these spiritual realities on earth, just give up being a clergy/religious! 
I think we can do all better without you spiritual hypocrites!"
"It's pretty simple to condemn BOTH the alt-right racist scum  and awful anti-Western attitudes like those the Islamists have. 


I've heard Sam Harris do it pretty well. 


Definitely cozying up to Trump on his nativism is not the way to go. He is the doddering old crazy uncle that sane people should ignore."

"oh, zinkie's FEELINGS are hurt because one of her favorite 'minorities' can'ta  live in fantasy world and BE SUPPORTED BY THE US TAXPAYERS!   Why should US taxpayers have to pay for their operations and LIFETIME medicines?  The tran is out of action for 238 days of action in the military (according to a study done last year) and CANNOT defend the country!  So why do we need such useless deviants  in the military if they can't perform mission one???  But zinky wants to FEEL GOOD.  and zinkie felt so good using her gutter language in writing about President Trump.   Here's a suggestion for zinky: go find yourself another country that's living in a fantasy world of your preference."
"Back in the 60's and 70's it was the rage of the left that it was global cooling... they shouted about the coming ice age... all due to man and oil. Late 80's they switched thier narrative in the opposite direction... ""global warming""!! Due to man and oil.
You do see point here??? 
Are you that young and dumb???"
"What a waste of time.   The Paris accords is all part of the globalist agenda to sell carbon credits and push the false global warming scheme
now called climate change since global warming has not been occurring.  The  goal is to reduce the quality of life for the West to third world while
elevating the third world countries to be on par with the new reduced quality of life for the West.  The ultimate goal is global control by the
One World Order fanatics.
Unfortunately  our political ruling elite have all signed up to promote this agenda.  Most are ""useful idiots"" wanting to jump on the train
for their own selfish interests."
From the same fools who would have us double military expenditures while denying climate change.  Typical.

"If I protest the seal hunt I don't buy sealskin products. If I protest the slaughtering of animals I don't eat meat. Coastal Protectors need to walk the talk to have credibility.

How did all these people have such stupid attorneys. That's who they should sue. There is no science behind the claim to begin with.
"This has to be one of the stupidest ideas I've ever come across as a ""team-building"" exercise when there is no requirement to deal with these kinds of disasters.   People who think they can control simulated disaster situations are exceedingly dangerous."
Nobody is dismissing. Why must you turn into a silly awkward caricature so many responses?
My comment exactly.  And the Dumbacrats are right there with them peddling this crap.
Wait for it... here comes da tweet with the words loser and low ratings.
If the democrats see this poll result you can bet they would try to cut Social Security. The stupid RINO's might also agree.

It seems Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE (where I understand he has business ties) are excluded and divided from their fellow Moslem countries), AND NOW IT SEEMS you are suggesting Canada has been (or is being) divided from the civilized world. Russia has been openly embraced, and the move is on to ditch Ukraine and Georgia, and the removal of sanctions seems to be on the agenda. Your run for cover is disgusting to me - it is appeasement - it didn't work with that other racist liar which cost the world so much in the 1940s. Why do you think this should be our national policy now?"

Trudeau speaks out of both sides of his face. In one breath he's telling Trump he's ready to get down to business and that he'll work with him. And the next he's tweeting how proud he is of Canadian women opposing President Trump. He's nothing but a  liar​ and a hypocrite.

"You have to be joking or just plain stupid.

When NBC, CBS, ESPN ETC gives you BILLIONS  ( 20.4 BILLION to be exact) you simply don't NEED RATINGS! The only people you are hurting with your stupid boycott are the people who work at the NETWORKS, the NFL will be just fine. Read it and weep , MORONS. 

Until the broadcast contract ended in 2013, the terrestrial television networks CBS ($3.73B), NBC ($3.6B) and Fox ($4.27B) — as well as cable television's ESPN ($8.8B) — paid a combined total of US$20.4 billion to broadcast NFL games.

"This clown Bishop McElroy along with quite a few others apparently, just doesn't get it:  A Muslim's primary purpose in life to to exterminate Christians, or anyone else who doesn't think like them.  Sweden is now the rape capitol of Europe and second in the world in rapes per capita, all thanks to the Muslim invaders.  They don't think like we do.  They do not share our values.  They have no respect for women, the environment, animals, or human life.  McElroy is naive and a fool.  Hopefully Darwins principle removes him from the picture because what he preaches is cultural and religious suicide.  A war is coming over the fate of the earth - Islam or Christianity.  We all need to pick which side we want to be on and quit consorting with the enemy."

"Two of the top educational systems in the world are in Singapore and Finland. They have for many years destroyed the US in terms of student outcomes. 

Singapore has a highly structured top-down system with  tightly scripted control of curriculum and testing for all students from the central government. Finland has a similar approach - there is no such thing as a private school - and many credit its success to 1) placing a high national value on the teaching profession and paying teachers accordingly and 2) paid high-quality universal preschool and daycare for all kids ages 3-7.

Neither country touts ""school choice"". They have committed to, and invest appropriately, in a consistent and top notch universal education for ALL of their country's students.  

But don't let facts get in the way of your effort to tear apart the US educational system. Carry-on with your ignorance..."

How stupid has the Democratic Party become to fail to realize that throwing everything under the bus leaves them with no credibility?  Working class Americans, blue collar workers, unionized workers, middle class workers, Christians, minorities, legal aliens, legal immigrants and the myriad others that were the base of the Democratic Party are now shunned and vilified by the elected and appointed Democratic politicians.

Non-violent dissent is a right in the US.

2) The US avoids violence when it can.  NK systematically uses violence against its own citizens and is currently threatening many countries around the world with annihilation because they have criticized NK.

3) The US basically observes international law.  NK regularly breaks international law, especially UN sanctions.

4) NK is based upon autarky. The US trades globally.

5) Military service is compulsory in NK and voluntary in the US.

6) NK leadership is based upon a divine cult of personality. US politicians are political pinatas.

7) NK believes that Koreans are the master race. The US severely punishes racists.

NK is an awful dictatorship run by a fascist, lunatic thug.

She is a master at propaganda and lies as well as a voice for the left at all costs including her soul.

Uh? Harper delivered 6 straight deficits including a record $56 billion in 2009-10. He lowered the HST lowered taxes and wiped out in no time flat a huge surplus he inherited from the Liberals.

The ones that help their communities and other charities. Want the nfl banned for the few players kneeling. When is probably less than 1% of the nfl kneeling. But you idiots think justice is nfl getting banned and all the players being out the job. Just seem so selfish and greedy that some people want that. Fuck all the players that stand that have served and that help out alot. They should all be out the job for the few the many shall pay. But of course greed is the american way.

McElroy: Go to Mexico and be a Bishop down there. You sicken me.
The Globe & Mail anti-Trump bias has infected the investing pages.  Time to cancel my subscription.  I don't need to pay for this trash.

How about producing plays where the President is assassinated and the left goes wild?
How about a Democrat going to a baseball field to massacre Republicans and the Democrats...especially the scum Obama...show little outrage?
And then we have Democrat women dressing up in the ""C"" caps and vagina suits prancing around and calling out for his assassination.

"Mr. Philip, your column is both arrogant and stupid. The day may come in some future century when the world no longer uses oil for its energy needs but that day is not now. The demand for oil both in Canada and beyond creates an opportunity for jobs and prosperity for all Canadians. And Pipelines are the most environmentally safe methods of getting our oil to market. You provide no alternative method for this and ultimately that is what makes your article so stupid."

"Great preseason, Ducks! Now the real season starts. The pitchers will be better, the batters will be better, and the fielders will be better. Games will be tighter, and sometimes you may be behind. But play loose and confident just as you have been. Believe in your teammates and your talent, which has never been better at Oregon. Three excellent pitchers, a batting lineup that just keeps hitting and hitting, and great fielding. The other Pac-12 teams should be worried, but they won't back down until you make them. Keep up the good work, and Go Ducks!"
Liberalism is really a mental disorder.
